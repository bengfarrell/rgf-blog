If you're in the South Bay or willing to travel, join me Saturday, 12/7, at the King San Jose Public Library for Local Lit!

Local Lit is an author fair with panels, publishing questions, book signings, and more! I'll be one of 10+ local authors taking part. [Full info at this link here.](https://www.sjpl.org/local-lit/)

I'm appearing at the Writers' Critique Clinic, starting at 1pm, and the Local Lit author fair, starting at 2pm and running until 4:30. All are free!

No registration needed for Local Lit, but if you'd like to take part in the Writers' Critique Clinic, you'll need to [click to register here.](https://sjpl.bibliocommons.com/events/673fd60d8fc0a328000db070) It'll be like speed dating for critiques with writing pros like me. You can choose from me, Alessandra Harris, Brooke L. French, or R.L. King!

Thanks to Eboni Harris for organizing the Critique Clinic, and to the San Jose Libraries and San Jose State University King Library for hosting the whole shindig. It's always great to make more connections in the Bay. If you want my signature and/or books, they'll be available at the fair.
