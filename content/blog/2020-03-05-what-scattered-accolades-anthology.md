I'm so thrilled that "What Scattered in the Wind" is reprinted in the _Accolades_ anthology from Women Who Submit Lit. The anthology launches today at the AWP conference in San Antonio.

"What Scattered in the Wind" first appeared in _Little Letters on the Skin_, a chapbook/anthology ([more info here](/creative-works/what-scattered-in-the-wind/)). It's a flash fiction horror tale of an older woman who wakes to find unwanted, and long forgotten, visitors to her isolated desert mesa.

What makes this reprint so special is that _Accolades_ is a celebration of the submissions, acceptances, and publications of members of the national [Women Who Submit Lit](https://eur04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwomenwhosubmitlit.org%2F&data=02%7C01%7C%7C1e03ea8664224baeee0708d7c0cd2d78%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637189859768495139&sdata=uKtste6J1yA9EvRR7N33BFyMuR27loidIQXe8pnlLGo%3D&reserved=0) organization, of which I run a local chapter.

Every other month, I spend two hours submitting out my work for publication and encouraging other writers to do the same. _Accolades_ is proof of how effective that support and time investment is, as all the works featured within it are reprints of writing WWSL members have had published elsewhere -- all that perseverance pays off!

_Accolades_ is available [in print from Amazon](https://eur04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAccolades-Women-Who-Submit-Anthology%2Fdp%2F1733241523&data=02%7C01%7C%7C1e03ea8664224baeee0708d7c0cd2d78%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637189859768505147&sdata=GJ6NFlwHjA8gJzImhjBLKWSiHJD4xYEAN%2BRtY5E1QZk%3D&reserved=0) for $15. Here are the leading lines into "What Scattered in the Wind":

> Hollow rasps of laughter pestered her to wakefulness. Any noise would have done the same, though she clamped her eyelids together in protest. For years, Ruth had heard nothing but the teakettle’s hiss or the slow scrape of her cane against the camper’s floor panels. The creaking sound of her voice rarely interrupted the silence. Unlike the other wayfarers, Ruth had never developed the habit of talking to herself. She didn’t care to hear what she’d have to say.

> _“Hee-hee, hee-he-heee!“_
