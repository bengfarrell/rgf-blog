**La Ronescina Pinot Grigio** Collio, Italy

This white wine smells mildly of cantaloupe, but no other scents jump out at me.  That’s probably because it’s extra chilled, which dulls the aroma — my bad. It tastes dry at first, but a sweetness swells up in the middle of the glass. The notes are vanilla with burnt edges, green apple, and more of a Santa Claus melon than cantaloupe. In other words, the melon flavor is timid. Overall, the wine tastes like an apple dipped in caramel that was left a little too long on the stovetop.

It’s pretty standard but tasty for a pinot grigio. If you’re a fan of this varietal, you’ll like this. If you’re like me and like to be surprised by your wine, then you may prefer to pass it on by.

Other Bloggers’ Thoughts:

[Colin Blogs](http://colintalcroft.blogspot.com/2011/08/wines-im-drinking-2009-la-ronescina.html):

A typical, very pale straw color, pretty in a well-chilled glass. Melon and sappy scents on the nose. A hint of lime. A suggestion of toasted grain. A little honey perhaps. Overall, fairly fresh and attractive. Quite tart on the palate with some fruity sweetness on the mid-palate followed again by a rush of tartness and then a delicate lingering finish with hints of nuts and an attractive slight bitterness at the very end. A trifle too tart perhaps, but at least this has some flavor and it's clean and refreshing with a little nuance. . . . Not complex or profound, but quite acceptable light summer wine.

[Eating with Bob and Suzette:](http://eatingwithbobandsuzette.blogspot.com/2012/02/february-14-2012-food-shopping-and.html)

It was minerally and dry with just a hint of fruity sweetness. After a few minutes, the mineral, tannic flavor subsided and the sweetness shone through . . . I think it is the best bottle of Pinot Grigio I have tasted for under $20.00.
