At the Speculative Fiction Showcase blog, Jessica Rydill [shares a nice interview with me](https://indiespecfic.blogspot.com/2022/11/interview-questions-for-rebecca-gomez.html?spref=tw) on a number of topics, many of them related to _Wings Unfurled_.

I love when interviews actually focus on the books themselves - most folks want to know more about the writing process than the story, so it was refreshing to take a deeper dive into the world on the page. Learn what headspaces the characters are in at the beginning of the work, my future writing plans, and even why my replicator order is "Absinthe verte, one cube."

[Be sure to read it here](https://indiespecfic.blogspot.com/2022/11/interview-questions-for-rebecca-gomez.html?spref=tw)! Thanks to Jessica for the opportunity.
