**Westbend Vineyards Le Noirien** _Other Words on the Label:_ 2005, Pinot Noir, Yadkin Valley

![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/photos/westbendlenoirien.jpg)

This pinot noir has quite the fiery nose with a strong alcohol presence, plum, and leather.  I taste lots of extra ripe plum, some raw sugar and a bit of bourbon.  It is tart with a light sweetness on some sips.   I might want it to mature longer to get rid of some of the unevenness but it's still good.
