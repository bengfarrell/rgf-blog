**Region:** Salento, Italy

This wine, emblazoned with the #33 on the label, is a blend of 33.3% each of cabernet, merlot, and montepulciano. It smells of dark maple syrup and tastes like you've bit into a bushel of dates.  There is also a hint of tobacco.  It's a bit bracing but also quite good.

> A decent, inexpensive red from Trader Joe's!  While I can't say it's one of my favorites, it certainly didn't disappoint me.  It has aromas of plum and slight dark chocolate.  The flavor is primarily dark berries and a bit of a smoky yet fruity finish.   When I first opened it, I noticed that it resembled cough syrup on the finish.  But let it breathe a while and it will be okay.

> . . . the wine is dark, full bodied, solid tannins, and surprisingly good, they could definitely charge double for this wine, it's a decent wine, I like it, and it's worth a shot. I had it with roasted veggies, but you can have it any way you like, it is also good on its own. Good tasting cheap wine is hard to find, at this price range I have been burned many times, but this is solid.

> As for this Italian Rosso I find it very earthy with a hint of leaves and stems. As with the flavor it does hint to the tannins, but does not have too much if any of powder after feel.
