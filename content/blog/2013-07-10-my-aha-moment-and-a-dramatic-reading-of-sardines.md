A few weeks back, I recorded my aha moment. How does one record an aha moment? Funny you should ask, because I didn't know either until the aha moment team asked me to come in and do a little video session with them for their national campaign. The "they" in all this is Mutual of Omaha, and "my aha moment" is an ad campaign they've been running for the past couple of years. It's a clever way to do promotions--a team of videographers tours the country and invites locals to come into their Airstream and share the aha moments that have set them down whatever path they are pursuing, whether charity work or a career.

You can peruse all the videos and commericals they've produced at their website. I participated at their Raleigh, NC, stop and shared about my writing and the moment when I realized I was a writer for real...at the tender age of 9 (maybe 10). Watch my aha moment below!

I think it turned out pretty well! But what didn't make it onto the reel was my dramatic reading of the poem I composed that day in Monterey. I can still picture the light blue paper I was finally able to jot it down on once we returned to the hotel in the evening, but alas, I no longer have the sheet of paper. I do still have the poem, however. And here I am, reading it in all it's fourth-grade glory.

Now I hadn't read that poem in years, and I surprisingly realized that (1) I was writing curveball horror twists in the 4th grade! Genre fiction is definitely for me; (2)  I was already concerned about sustainable food! I honed right in on how overfishing had destroyed Cannery Row's sardine trade, no doubt having heard it from a tour guide or read it in the tourbook on the way to Monterey; and (3) I managed to capture a sense of place for Cannery Row, which is something I always try to do in my travel posts. It's hilarious to me that my writing interests have not shifted much since that time.

I hope you enjoyed my aha moment and "Sardines." I may make a series out of reading my elementary-school short stories and poems. Any guess as to what's going on with this picture?

And yes, that's a giant blue whale with rainbows and clouds on its skin. Oh yes, it's a winner, my friends. Think _Lightspeed_ would be interested?
