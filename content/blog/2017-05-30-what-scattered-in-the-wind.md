**Update! This reading and publication has been postponed until 8/11. All other details remain the same. Join me in August instead!**

My next short story publication is coming up soon! And I will soon be taking part in a reading to celebrate the launch for the anthology/chapbook it will appear in: _Little Letters on the Skin_. I do hope you'll join me.

**What?** The Cleave: Bay Area Women Writers and the Liminal Center Release of the _Little Letters on the Skin_

**When?** Friday, June 9, 2017   Friday, August 11, 2017

**Where?** The Octopus Literary Salon, 2101 Webster St, Oakland.

**Time?** 7 pm.

Eight other writers and myself, who have been involved with Oakland's amazing creative space for feminists and womanists, [the Liminal Center,](http://www.oaklandliminal.com/) will be taking part in the reading and small group Q & A afterward. The anthology will be available for purchase, with all profits going to help support the work of the Liminal Center, which I've written about before [here](/blog/2016/05/reading-tonight-at-liminal/) and [here](/blog/2016/07/final-liminal-writers-in-residence-reading/). I will also bring along a few copies to sell of _Typehouse Literary Magazine #9_, which featured my humorous sci-fi story, ["Mixed Signals, or, Learning How to Speak,](/creative-works/mixed-signals-or-learning-how-to-speak/)" last September.

"What Scattered in the Wind" is not humorous sci-fi, that's for sure. Rather, it's horror flash fiction done in a poetic prose style, and it's the first story I wrote upon moving to the Bay Area. I love the mood of it, and the angst within it, that of a woman struggling with her biggest regret in life and sentenced to forever re-remember it. The first lines?

> Hollow rasps of laughter pestered her to wakefulness. Any noise would have done the same, though she clamped her eyelids together in protest. For years, Ruth had heard nothing but the teakettle's hiss or the slow scrape of her cane against the camper's floor panels. The creaking sound of her voice rarely interrupted the silence. Unlike the other wayfarers, Ruth had never developed the habit of talking to herself. She didn't care to hear what she'd have to say.

What I am most excited about for this event, however, is the exceptional list of fellow writers reading with me, at least half of whom I've read with before and they are STELLAR:
