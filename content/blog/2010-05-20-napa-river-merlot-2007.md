**Region:** Napa County, CA

Nose: Clove, tobacco, and prune in that order.

There's a lot of fruit in this medium-bodied wine including raspberry, cherry, and prune. Clove notes hang out for the aftertaste. It's not terribly complex, but it's a good, easy sipper.

[Star Silver Creek](http://www.starksilvercreek.com/2009/01/napa-river-merlot-2005-mysterious-in-origin-trader-joes-review.html) on the 2005 vintage

The flavor itself is unbalanced, with a mix of unpleasant tannins, with occasional hints of blackberry trying to break through. I also found it slightly sour. To be sure I've tasted far worse in this price range. . . . After opening, I left it in the cellar for a day or two to see if any characteristics would change. Unfortunately, but not surprising, the answer is no. Bottom line on this one is pass.

[Wine Cast](http://winecast.net/2006/11/07/napa-river-merlot-2003/) on the 2003 vintage

Garnet color with a purple rim. Blackberry, currant, and vanilla aromas. In the mouth, this wine seems a bit disjointed with plum, blackberry, pepper, and spice flavors finishing with medium tannins and some heat from alcohol (which I expect is closer to 13.5% than the listed 12.5%). The mid-palate seems to be missing here but it is still worth the $5 spent and three bucks better than the Charles Shaw "Kool-Aid" Merlot.
