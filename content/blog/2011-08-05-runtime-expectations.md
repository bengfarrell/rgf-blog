Runtime Expectations is a live talk show on software development.  I co-host with Bucky Schwarz and Adrian Pomilio.

The show page is over on CodebassRadio:

[http://codebassradio.net/shows/runtime-expectations/](http://codebassradio.net/shows/runtime-expectations/)

We also have a meetup page that we schedule shows and invite people to sit in: [http://runtimeexpectations.com](http://runtimeexpectations.com).

Adrian came up with the show name - I warmed up to it pretty fast despite wanting to come up with something better.  Now that we're 8shows in, I couldn't imagine a better name.

Here's the final logo I came up with.  I originally thought we could base it on the Windows alert when an error pops up.  Adrian had the idea to tilt it, and then I put the finishing touches on.

Here's what we had for the first couple of shows.  The Durham American Tobacco District is pictured in the background cause that's where we broadcast from
