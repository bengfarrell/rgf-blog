Just for the week, I swear! I'm currently cameraless, and I've got editing projects (you know, the type that actually pay me $$) to get done, so the blog has fallen to the wayside this week. See you Monday with pictureless updates on Jujube's latest wine dinner, and hopefully, picture-filled ones on frost brandy, "coy" sake, and Panciuto.
