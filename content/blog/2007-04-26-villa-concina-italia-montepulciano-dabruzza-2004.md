**Villa Concina-Italia** Other words on the label: Montepulciano D'Abruzza 2004, Central Italy

 

This is a medium-bodied wine that goes down smoothly. It is dangerous to drink because it's light on flavor, making it easy to ingest quickly. The wine is leathery with a hint of plum but the texture is similar to dissolved paper grains. Yes, I know what dissolved paper grains feel like in your mouth. No, I won't explain.

The wine smells the same as it tastes but with a tinge of sugar. The elusiveness of flavor makes it potentially interesting but I was bored with the hunt after a glass.
