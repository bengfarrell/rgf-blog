More specifically, one of the websites I blog for is in _Durham Magazine_, a local publication that talks all things Durham-related. Here's the announcement I posted on [Carpe Durham](http://www.carpedurham.com/) about the article, since I'm just not going to think of something new and exciting to say in its place here:

> Our website has been profiled in the new issue of _Durham Magazine_, the Foodie issue!
> 
> [![](images/eatbloglove-214x300.jpg)](http://carpedurham.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/eatbloglove.jpg)
> 
> Pick up a copy, and you will learn the history of how **RPP** and **YAR** started Carpe Durham (including their and some of our real names–ooh, ahh!), the basic premise behind how a restaurant gets written up (it’s not complicated, folks), and how you—the active, opinionated, and fantastic readers and commentators here—have made this site a success.
> 
> In addition to some of our regular bloggers’ thoughts, comments by **Lysistrata, 9/9,** and **burgeoningfoodie** on past posts have also been printed to showcase those lively debates we have.
> 
> Besides the article on Carpe Durham, you really should pick up this issue of _Durham Magazine_. There are wonderful pictures of many favorite dishes at local restaurants that an amateur photographer like myself could only dream of taking, an article on the supper clubs cropping up around Durham, and profiles on beloved restaurant staff.
> 
> [_Durham Magazine_](http://www.durhammag.com/) is $4 and available at Parker & Otis, The Regulator Bookshop, Barnes & Noble at Southpoint and New Hope Commons, Sweets and News at Northgate Mall, Gurley Pharmacy, Whole Foods, and Sam’s Quik Shop.

So if you live locally, pick it up!
