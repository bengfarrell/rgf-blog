**Meridian 2006 Dry Rose** Other words on the label: I'd know if the label didn't fall off and the wine hadn't sat in the fridge for a month before I got around to trying it.

This wine is unimpressive. It's drinkable but there's really nothing exciting going on in the glass. Maybe there would be if the lime flavor weren't so overpowering. I want to like the core of strawberries but it was lost beneath all that lime. Granted, the hint of honey is appealing but the complete lack of smell is not. Yes, I did drink it cold, thus dulling any scent but really, I do that all the time and I can still smell something! Drink if you have nothing else on hand.
