Expect my blog posts to continue being a bit sporadic until the new year—we are headed out of town to visit friends and family in LA in a week, so while I hope to keep up posts, I'm not hitting quite as many restaurants lately due to lack of time!  I do plan to incorporate more non-review blogs soon, likely just short thoughts on writing or whatever else may strike me, to break up my own blogging monotony. Let me know what you think about the greater mix of topics when I do!

P.S., I'm not phasing out pictures of wine bottles: I forgot to take them for these last two reviews!

**Region:** South Eastern Australia

The nose is smoky. It has an even-keeled, mellow flavor with cherries and smoke. It almost tastes like beef jerky, but not in a gross way. As you drink it more, the cherries get tarter or maybe they are unripe blackberries? Whatever the fruit, there's a lot of tannin power.

**Other Bloggers' Thoughts:**

Chelsie @ [Chelsie's Tasting Notes](http://chelsieswines.blogspot.com/2007/08/5-merlot-black-swan-australia-albertons.html)

> This wine is a pretty standard Merlot. Fruity with berry notes and a slightly mapley finish. A few notes of figs and raisins are noticeable after a few sips. This is a pretty decent merlot. I would buy it again.

> I give this wine 4 out of 5 stars.
