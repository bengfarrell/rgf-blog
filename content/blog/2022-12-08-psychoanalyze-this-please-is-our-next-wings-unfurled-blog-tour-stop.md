Today's _Wings Unfurled_ Book Tour Blog Stop is at TKentWrites.com! I'd like to think them for hosting my short post on "Psychoanalyze This! Please?" in which I talk about my dislike of the idea that all authors' work are autobiographical in some form . . . while also wondering if maybe some of the symbols and images that fascinate me _do_ have deeper meaning for my life and I just don't know it! Read it here:

Also be sure to swing by Meerkat Press's _Wings Unfurled_ Blog Tour [masterpost](https://meerkatpress.com/wings-unfurled-blog-tour-giveaway/) to enter their $50 giftcard prize drawing! There are not quite 100 entries yet, so now's a great time to get your name in there. Good luck!

As promised, here is a line from _Wings Unfurled_, with no context. I'm sharing one each day we have a new blog tour post to feature.

See you for tomorrow's blog post feature!
