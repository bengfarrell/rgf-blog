**Region:** North Coast, CA

Smell: Oak, touch of cinnamon, dash of plum.

Taste: A well-rounded wine with minimal fruit, though there is that bit of plum. There's also a mellow presence of spices with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and some light vanilla.

This wine is fine and dandy but nothing special.

**Other Bloggers' Thoughts:**

[_Boozing It_](http://boozingit.blogspot.com/2009/12/rootstock-north-coast-syrah-2007.html)

Really deep dark purple color. Aromas of plum, blackberry, and oak. Once it starts to open up there is a very sweaty nose to it. Gym socks are not pleasing. Flavors of vanilla, sour cherry, pepper, blackberry, strawberry, and oak. Pick up a lot more on the palate then on the nose. Very dry finish. The balance is way off on this wine.

[_Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, and Wine_](http://sagegardenkitchen.blogspot.com/2010/01/january-farmers-market-risotto-i-love.html)

The Rootstock is an inexpensive, medium-bodied wine with a dark, smoky nose and rich mouthfeel.
