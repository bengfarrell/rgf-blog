Alfredo's Pizza Villa is a Chapel Hill pizzeria that recently opened a new location in Southwest Durham.  Inside, you can get whole pizzas, slices, calzones, subs, and pasta. There's plenty of inside seating with little atmosphere provided by the dark blue walls and brick interior, but the outdoor seating area seemed quite nice.

We started with a caesar salad.

One salad was good to serve two to three people as an appetizer. It came with a small slice of bread. The lettuce was cut into huge bites; you definitely need to divvy it up into smaller bits. The parmesan was of the sprinkle variety.

The main event came up next.

Alfredo's is a definitely a great choice for pizza. I'm not sure about the rest of their menu items, but the pizza was really yummy. We ordered a 16" white pizza that comes with mozzarella, spinach, tomatoes, basil, olive oil, and feta cheese. The flavors combined really well: the spinach and feta were especially bright, and just the right amount of olive oil was used. They might have gone a little overboard with the basil. The crust was also worth noting. It was too thin in the middle for me, making for droopy pizza for the first few bites (New Yorkers might like this) but the crust was almost pillowy on the outer edge with a crisp outer shell. There was lots of garlic, too. It was a great pizza.

I don't think I'd be drawn again to Alfredo's if the pizza weren't so good. But that was definitely impressive enough to give them another try.
