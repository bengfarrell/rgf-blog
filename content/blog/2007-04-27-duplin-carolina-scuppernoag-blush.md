**Duplin Carolina Scuppernoag Blush**

Smell: Standard white wine dish soap smell.

First sip: This was a battle between a tart, very unripe grape and a sweet, yet chalky, unidentified flavor.

Color: Warm and rosy on top, with a little separation of color towards the bottom, leading to a white gold effect.

Gulp: The grape stays with you most but there's also a hint of bubbly.

Extra flavor: A sliver of tree bark also enters the foray. Since I chewed wood often as a kid, that's a plus.
