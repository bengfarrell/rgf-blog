**Santa Alicia Reserve Carmenere 2005**

The acidity of this wine hits you first but it mellows quickly into a cool earthiness, where you can feel the mossy dirt rub between your toes. I taste chocolate, dried strawberries, and allspice when it lingers. While all are appealing flavors, they don't combine well. I couldn't finish my glass.
