102 East Main Street\
Carrboro, NC\

Dinner Entrees from $9-20

This was our first time at the Carrboro location of Tyler's. The atmosphere is very pub-like but with a bit of an upscale feel due to the brass bars on the side and in the back. Otherwise, very much a wooden slats on the walls sort of place with a mix of booths and tables.

Mr. Gourmez tried a Castille Rouge beer from their beer lists, which is less extensive than that of their Durham location. It was fantastic, tasting like cherries and cream. I had [The Cue-Tue](https://thegourmez.com/blog/2009/02/12/the-cue-tue-cocktail-tylers-restaurant-and-tap-room/), which was also delicious.

The menu is a step above your standard neighborhood joint, with plenty to choose from. I opted for that evening's special, cod with gnocchi, artichoke hearts, sweet potatoes, and spinach. The gnocchi was too gummy, which is a common problem when eating in or out. The cod was cooked well though a stronger sauce tying the ingredients together would have been appreciated. The veggies were great and cooked at the right level between crisp and mush. I think that new potatoes would have been better than sweet ones for this dish. Pretty tasty, though!

Overall, we'll be back to Tyler's when looking for some good food before a night out. The attached Speakeasy is definitely a plus and the drinks are a good draw.
