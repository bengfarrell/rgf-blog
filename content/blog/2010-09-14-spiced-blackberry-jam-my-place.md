Shake everything together but the grapes. Place a few grapes in each cocktail glass, then pour the cocktail on top. Of course, using blackberries would make a lot more sense, but I didn't have them, and the champagne grapes worked very well.

This drink has a gorgeous purple-brown color, like a cloudy amethyst. Using Trader Joe's blackberry juice gave it some nice texture and was the main contributor to the cloudiness. It's fun to drink---a smidge more blackberry and St. Germain's would give it the little bit of extra pizzazz it needs. The lime goes well with the blackberry---I thought I used too little lime at first, but as I drink it, I think it's just about right. Of course, if you add a bit more blackberry like I suggested, then bump up the lime a tad, too.
