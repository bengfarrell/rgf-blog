Wow, the Sauza tequila comes out strong in this margarita.  So does the house sweet and sour blend.  It's really, really sour.  I can't pick out the Grand Marnier but that's probably because my mouth is too busy puckering due to the lemon juice.  If you try this one out, don't get a salt rim: it just intensifies the citrus.
