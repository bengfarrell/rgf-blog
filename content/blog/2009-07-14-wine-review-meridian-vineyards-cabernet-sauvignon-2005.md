**Meridian Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon 2006** Other words on the label:  California ![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/photos/meridiancab.jpg)

This wine has a spicy nose of cumin and rich cinnamon.  Figs are the central fruit though there is also a small bit of pipe tobacco on the finish.  It is tart and spicy.  For people like me who love a spicy wine, it is highly drinkable if a bit rough around the edges.
