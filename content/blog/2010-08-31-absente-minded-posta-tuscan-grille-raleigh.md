The Absente Minded cocktail, which I tried at the Triangle Foodie Tweetup held last week at Posta Tuscan Grille, was a delightful, satisfying, smooth cocktail. I enjoyed it so much that night that I came back the next one for another before heading to the Adam Lambert concert at Raleigh Memorial Auditorium across the street. While I'm on the subject, this restaurant and bar is the perfect spot for preshow dinner and/or drinks. I'll mention the atmosphere of the restaurant a bit when I post on the tweetup, but for the bar, it's very welcoming, and full of rich, warm browns and red, and marble countertops. There's plenty of seating and sunlight also brightens the place up if you're there early enough. They've got a great list of fancy schmancy cocktails (music to my ears) and a nice selection of wine, beer (all local), and spirits.

Back to the drink: I'm a big fan of absinthe and love the high profile it's been getting in cocktails for the last couple years since entering the US market. This absinthe cocktail is made with, well, absinthe, but also limoncello, peach schnapps, and orange and cranberry juices.

You wouldn't necessarily think that licorice and lemon, or licorice and cranberry, went together, but the peach schnapps smooths over any disconnect between the disparate flavors. The licorice isn't subtle, but it's at just the right level before veering into overwhelming. The fruit and citrus flavors complement it quite well. It's lightly sweet and wonderfully delicious.
