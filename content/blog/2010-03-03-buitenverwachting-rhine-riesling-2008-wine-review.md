**Buitenverwachting Rhine Riesling 2008** South Africa

![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/gourmez/photos/rhineriesling.jpg)

Even after much swishing, the nose is elusive. Some grass, some lime, maybe.

I thought it was bubbly at first, which definitely confused me, but it's just so bright of a wine that it seems bubbly.  The lime from the nose is there with mellow grapefruit and mint. It's like drinking a Smartee and has the same level of sweetness as those candies.

I like this wine a lot, which is great because I've been in a riesling dry spell. They've all seemed too sweet and mediocre lately, and I'm glad to have found one I enjoy again.

**Other Bloggers' Thoughts:**

So I was searching for other reviews and what did I find? That I drank this wine at a wine dinner a few months ago! The write-up of that review is [here](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/?p=627). I was mainly struck by the lime then and didn't enjoy the wine quite as much overall. Perhaps my drought of good riesling options has made me appreciate it more?

[Oeno Log on the 2005 vintage](http://oenologictn.blogspot.com/2008/06/rhine-of-ancient-mariner.html)

A dry, windswept plain of stark minerality, or perhaps like drinking plate glass. With such an endless (but featureless) horizon, I'd like a little more persistence on the finish, but this is a pretty good wine anyway, and there would seem to be potential.
