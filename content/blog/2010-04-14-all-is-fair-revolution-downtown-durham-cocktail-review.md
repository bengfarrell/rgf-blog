Now this cocktail isn't one you are going to see again.

Of course, it's pretty to look at, and it sounds great: Jim Beam bourbon, lemon bitters, muddled strawberries, and basil are shaken together and poured over ice.  I liked the foam on top when it was served to me, but the drink needed a bit more refinement. The bourbon and strawberries definitely dominated, to the point that I wasn't sure I could taste the other ingredients-I like to taste them all. If the basil and bitter amounts were increased and maybe a smoother bourbon added, I would love it.

Now, why aren't you going to be able to try it yourself? Because this drink was specially created to promote Anoop Desai's new album, [_All is Fair_](http://www.anoopdesai.com/). Anoop, of course, was one of the top ten finalists on American Idol last year and is a Chapel Hill resident when he's not in other parts of the country working on his career. He was on hand as part of Revolution's local celebrity bartending evenings, and he bartended looking only mildly like a deer caught in headlights.

Anoop was really pleasant to talk to, exhibiting all of that easy charm he had on the show and the tour. He answered a few questions for me about the album and his travels. His friends and family were on hand to support him and the cause of the evening, the [Eve Carson Memorial Fund.](http://universityrelations.unc.edu/alert/carson/carsonfund.html) Definitely check out Revolution's future celebrity bartenders if for no other reason than to try the signature drink of the evening and support a cause.
