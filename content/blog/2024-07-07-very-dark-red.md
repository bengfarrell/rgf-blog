*Obligatory disclaimer:* This wine was provided to me as a free sample for review on this blog. It’s designed to be a high alcohol (15%), high sugar wine with soft tannins, rich flavors, and a deep, dark color. In other words, the [Very Dark Red Wine](https://verydarkredwines.com/products/vdr-red-blend) is meant to be appealing to the average consumer on the grocery store shelf.

# Thoughts on the Very Dark Red Wine

*Would I drink it again?* Yes!

*At this $25 price?* Seems pretty reasonable for a crowd-pleaser wine, but I do think it may be too rich for some palates.

*Most memorable flavors?* This wine is quite rich, reaching into Port’s more typical flavors with brown sugar and walnuts along with juicy cherries and boysenberry syrup. There’s a teasing tickle of peppery spices and a vanilla after taste. It’s tasty! But I wouldn’t recommend drinking it too fast, because it’ll hit you even faster. It seems precisely blended to appeal to a broad swath of wine drinkers . . . and that means it tastes good to me, so I’m in.

*Reviewed 2 October 2022.*
