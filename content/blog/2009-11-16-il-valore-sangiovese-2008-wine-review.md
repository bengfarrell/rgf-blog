Wine: **Il Valore Sangiovese 2008** Region:  Puglia, Italy

![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/gourmez/photos/ilvalore004.jpg)

I smell clove and nectarines. The nectarine is replaced by black raspberry as I drink it but neither fruit is the star.  Rather, they are encased by a clove shell that dominates the glass.  I think it's a fabulous combination of spice and fruit, in just the right proportion. The wine seems medium-bodied at first but it's thick as it goes down the throat.

> First off, I'd just like to say that this wine is very, very tart. It has a pungent, spicy aroma and a dry, sour taste to it that lingers well after you've set down the glass. I realize after some contemplation that the primary flavor (other than, you know, grapes) is quite cranberry-esque. It almost reminds me of Ocean Spray Cranberry-Juice Cocktail, although with alcohol. I imagine it'll pair quite well with Craisins. Or maybe, you know, meat.

> Overall, this is a decent red that helps fight urinary tract infections. I'll give it 3 out of 5.
