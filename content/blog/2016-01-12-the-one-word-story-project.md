In November, I stumbled across Rob Kristoffersen's (@kristoffrable) [One Word Story Project](http://teamhellions.com/2015/12/24/the-one-word-story-project/) while browsing my Twitter feed. A group of authors writing stories each inspired by one word? Sounded like a lot of fun!

I'd been looking for ways to share my fiction more often, as I had limited myself to publishing stories only with professionally rated Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America outlets, and I wasn't feeling satisfied by the awesome, yet limited, opportunities they provide. So Rob's project seemed perfect! As he's a contributor at Team Hellions, a geek website covering a wide range of fandoms (even wrestling!), the stories will be hosted there.

And the first one is up today! Fittingly, the series begins with Rob's story, "The Home is Where the Haunting Is," which is inspired by the word _epicedium_: a funeral dirge. [Click on over](http://teamhellions.com/2016/01/11/the-one-word-story-home-is-where-the-haunting-is-by-rob-kristoffersen/) to read this tale, which, like my own, is a haunting story with marriage at its forefront. Rob's tale is an affecting look into the aftermath of divorce, and it ends especially strong.

There will be a new One Word Story up at Team Hellions every weekday for a month, through 2/11/2016. My own is inspired by _misogamy_: a hatred of marriage, and I'll tell you when it's up, of course! Â But I'll also point you over to the site whenever I especially enjoy the other writers' stories.
