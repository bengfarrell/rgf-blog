Fogcon 2019 starts tomorrow!

![fogcon, 2019](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/07195049/Screenshot_2019-02-22-FOGcon-Science-Fiction-and-Fantasy-Convention-in-the-SF-Bay-Area.png)

As per usual, I don't feel ready, but do I ever for conventions? This year, I'll be at Fogcon all weekend. Here is my schedule, should you care to join me at any point:

**Friday, 4:30 pm, Salon A/B:** It's Dangerous to Go Alone! Take This--Writer Support Networks in the Bay Area. _Panelist_.

> Scene: The writer types alone, perhaps with a bottle of bourbon for companionship and a cat on the lap. The writing lifestyle is often portrayed as solitary, but as with all careers, writers need support to improve and to get their work seen by the wider world. Come learn what resources are available for speculative fiction writers in the Bay Area, from critique groups, to marketing, to writing classes, to kicking back and talking writer shop with others going through the creative struggle of the written word.

**Saturday, 10:00 am, Salon F:** Discovering Short Fiction. _Panelist_**_._**

> We live in golden age for short SFF, but there’s so much out there and relatively few reviews and recommendations compared to novels. How are people finding short fiction? What are some techniques the panelist can suggest for those looking to read more short stories? And what can the community do to help showcase the awesome short fiction happening now?

**Saturday, noon, Lobby Bar:** East Bay Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Meetup Group Craft Klatsch. _Host._

> Join [my East Bay critique group](https://www.meetup.com/East-Bay-Science-Fiction-and-Fantasy-Writers/events/259201266/) for SF/F writers during Saturday's lunch hour in Fogcon's lobby bar to unwind from the con so far and catch up on what's been great and what folks are looking forward to next.

**Saturday, 8:00 pm, Salon F:** Small Houses, Big Futures--Publishing SF with Small Presses. _Moderator._ 

> While many of us dream of a Big 5 deal, there are numerous Small Press publishers that are taking risks the larger publishers can't, giving more writers access to the market. But that access comes with smaller (or no) advances and a larger proportion of labor on the author. What's different about publishing with a Small Press vs. a big publishing house? How is the experience different, for the editor and for the writer?

**Sunday, 1:30 pm, Santa Rosa room:** Broad Universe Rapid Fire Reading. _Host and Reader._

> Broad Universe is one of the oldest organizations supporting female writers of speculative fiction. At conventions nationwide, Broad Universe hosts Rapid Fire Readings to highlight the amazing work of our members. Several members of the group take part by sharing short bursts of fiction that keep the reading lively and exciting.

And from there...home! Is it wrong that I'm looking forward to that last part already?
