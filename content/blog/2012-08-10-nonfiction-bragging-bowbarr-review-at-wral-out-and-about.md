It's a Thursday, and the first one I've blogged on in a while. That's what vacation will do to you. ,)  Speaking of vacation, I had another WRAL review published while I was gone, and it's this Thursday's bragging post. This one was cocktail-centric and focused on evaluating whether [Bowbarr](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bowbarr/278762103220 "Bowbarr on Facebook") is a good spot to take friends with varying alcohol tastes or not. Here's your teaser:

> I’m always on the hunt for a bar that can satisfy both my preference for strong drinks and my friends’ for cocktails that are fruitier and easier going down. **[Bowbarr](http://www.wral.com/Carrboro/Bar/Bowbarr/8754969/)** is a club right on the edge of Carrboro and Chapel Hill that’s garnered a reputation for interesting cocktails, which made me think it might satisfy all our alcoholic hankerings.
> 
> In addition to libations, Bowbarr offers a small selection of assorted snacks like cheese and cracker sandwich packs, wasabi peas and pistachios. Beers are available by the bottle and draft. Foothills was the only local brewery we recognized on the small draft list.

You can find the rest of the review over at [Out and About here](http://www.wral.com/entertainment/out_and_about/blogpost/11309457/ "Out and About Bowbarr review"). Enjoy! And drink some bourbon.
