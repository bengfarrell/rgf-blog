_Other words on the label: Producto de Espana_

The label displays an abstract, lined portrait on a mustard yellow background.

The nose brings me back to my first taste of freeze-dried strawberries at the San Francisco exploratorium when I was young. Astronaut food totally rocks. Paprika also has a presence here.

As for the actual taste, it is much less tart than the nose. Rich, ripe strawberries provide a well-rounded flavor with a subtle cardamom spice to perk them up.

This is a light and refreshing red wine but it lacks character after the first few sips.
