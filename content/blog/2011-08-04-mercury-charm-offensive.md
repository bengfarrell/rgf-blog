Back when I lived in Boston....lets say 2001 to 2005, I was in a rock band called Mercury Charm Offensive.  I played keyboard, and well I was their resident graphic and web designer.  I designed our logo too, see below!

Our first album was called "Fancy Plans and Pants to Match", named after a Jimmy James NewsRadio quote.

Here's the back cover:

And then our second album (I stole the photo from my wife):

And as I said...I did the web design
