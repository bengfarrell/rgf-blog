This smells of flowers and oranges: it would make a great, subtle perfume. It tastes very floral also, with a bit of pine that adds more depth from the outdoors. There’s lemon but not in the off-putting, dish soap way (thank god I haven’t had one of those in forever). It’s creamy, pretty sweet, and pleasant. The sweetness lessens as it warms up. Usually sweet white wine sends me running to the hills, but this one is more of a raw sugar that simply rounds out the glass.

I’m not infatuated, but I’m close.
