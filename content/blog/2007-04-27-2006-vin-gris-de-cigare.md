**Other stuff on the label:** Bonny Doon Vineyards

This wine is from Bonny Doon Vineyards newly acquired vines in France. There's something innately appealing about this label-probably because of their tongue in cheek use of an old French ordinance. Look it up.

This is my first rose to review and I'm looking forward to the change of pace. I picked up the bottle while visiting my college campus, UC Santa Cruz. It's an opaque salmon hue, with curtains of gold around the outskirts. The smell is too light to describe; eventually, I'll try all my wines at room temperature to accentuate the nose, but probably not until I convince Mr. Gourmez to move overseas.

It's fairly acidic for a pink wine, as Bonny Doon labeled it, which is why I enjoyed it at the tasting room. I don't shirk from sugar but I do like balance. My first thought at taste is green apple but as it lingers, I'm more inclined towards casaba melon. I've only had casaba melon once and found it rather bland but in wine form, it packs more of a flavor punch. There's a slight tang of eucalyptus at the end. Yes, I chewed eucalyptus leaves as a child.
