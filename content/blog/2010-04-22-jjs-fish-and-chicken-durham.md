**JJ's Fish and Chicken** 1403 South Miami Boulevard East Durham Sandwiches: $3.89--$5.50 Chicken and Seafood Dinners: $5.99--$10.99

The management asked me not to take pictures at this establishment, so I'll just try and describe the place for you. It's a pretty nice, clean, order-at-the-counter restaurant with some country clutter in the form of wood barrels and wooden fish and oars on the walls. The outside of it is covered with names of the different types of fish that they offer, and signs in the windows advertise a drive-through window. Food options were varied, from fried chicken and seafood platters to gyros and jerk shrimp. There were also dessert options, including banana pudding, red velvet and coconut cakes, and cookies, but the case was pretty well cleared out by mid-evening.

I learned once I searched for a website link that it's actually a chain that has a lot of presence in California and Wisconsin, and a smaller presence all across the US. The menu seems to vary widely from place to place, and I'd imagine the customer service does, too. Let's just say they don't like pictures taken at all at this location.

I ordered a medium-sized trout dinner, with green beans and coleslaw that I ended up taking to go. Hush puppies were automatically included.

![](http://www.thegourmez.com/gourmez/photos/jjschickenseafood2.jpg)  The trout was pretty good with a simple, crunchy batter. Watch out for bones, though. The green beans were horrible, steamed to death with no flavor whatsoever and cooked to death. The hush puppies were fine and of the tubular, chewy variety (Who knew when I first tried hush puppies in my college cafeteria that they came in so many varieties?). The coleslaw was pretty good. It was very finely diced except for the carrots and had a good flavor with only a mild sweetness.

Sides are very important to me, so I probably wouldn't go back with green beans like those, even though the fish was fine. Has anyone tried the chicken?
