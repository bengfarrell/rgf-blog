This drink, with its bloody trail of maraschino juice, looks like it'd be great for a Halloween party. It's made with vodka, Malibu coconut rum, pineapple juice, and more than a splash of blue curacao.

It's a great, simple tropical punch, perfect for sipping on a porch or by a pool on a hot day, or in my case, on a day in the sixties that seemed hot in comparison to our wretched winter weather. Very sweet, but this sort of drink should be. There was a hint of orange from the curacao that gave it depth but I think lime would have added a lot more.  If I discount it watering down too quickly, I enjoyed it thoroughly.
