**Les Caves Joseph Bordeaux Rouge 2007** France

![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/gourmez/photos/lescavesjosephbordeaux.jpg)

This Bordeaux smells peppery and tingles my nose. It is dry and tart, with a berry flavor of deep, dark cherries. There's an extra layer to it that's like molasses but not sweet  . . . rum notes?

The wine is very drinkable, especially the more you drink of it! It would likely go better with food than on its own.

. . . the Bordeaux was a LOT smoother. The aroma and flavor was grapey, and it was deep purple in color . . . It felt robust and velvety in my mouth-instead of attacking my tongue, it seemed to roll along my palate.

The big thing on the nose here is cinnamon. Earthy, spicy, dirty, funky - some cherries as well, but this is a dirty, filthy wine with good acid and nice, velvety tannins. The fruit comes through as the bottle opens, but so does a strong, freshly tanned leather quality. I feel like I'm chewing on a leather jacket. Dried spices linger on the finish - from the dark brown cinnamon and clove to the green oregano and basil.

[Decant Stop Tasting](http://decantstoptasting.com/?p=10)

This is a blend of 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, and that's pretty much what it tastes like.  It is rare to be let down by a wine from the Bordeaux region, and this one doesn't either, given that it only costs $5 at TJ's.  Not bad for the price to be sure.  Not a lot of nose, but what there is, is pleasant.  It has a full and relatively complex flavor with not a lot of lingering after-taste.  Goes really well with cheese and other savories.  If you're on a tight budget and looking for an everyday drinker, consider this one.
