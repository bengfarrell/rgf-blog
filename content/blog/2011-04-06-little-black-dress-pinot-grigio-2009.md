**Little Black Dress 2009 Pinot Grigio** California

This is bitter! That doesn’t happen often with white wines. It’s also herbal, but I did eat a bite of rosemary just before digging in, so I may be biased. I don’t taste rosemary, though, but more oregano or marjoram. There is the typical green apple I taste in many white wines but also lychee. A crème brûleé flavor is struggling to be tasted, but with the tart apple, it’s not that strong of a factor. If there were more of it and less apple, I’d find this wine more appealing.

[Gamblelynn on Wine](http://gamblelynnonwine.com/2009/04/27/little-black-dressno-longer-just-for-women/) on an unknown vintage

Although light, this wine makes a lasting impression on you with its clean citrus flavor. Chilled, this wine goes well with a variety of foods or stands alone as a refreshing drink on a hot summer day.  Like that little black dress in your closet, this wine with its floral aroma and hints of tangerine and orange goes well with any special (or not so special) occasion.

[Recession Wines](http://recession-wines.com/black-dress-pinot-grigio/)

This wine will definitely not disappoint.  The aroma of the wine is of multiple fruits (lemon, berries, grapefruit, and some mango).  The taste is evenly balanced almost like passion fruit with a sweet finish.  We tasted this wine without pairing, just for pleasure, and it was phenomenal.

[Thursday Happy Hour](http://www.thursdayhappyhour.com/2010/04/little-black-dress-pinot-grigio.html)

It tasted like spring, a little grassy, even. With flavors of oranges and lemons, this wine is fruity without being too sweet. It's actually a little bit tart.
