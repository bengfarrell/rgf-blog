**Mattie's Perch Shiraz** Other words on the label: Southeastern Australian "Ripper"

The nose is very fruity---tart, unripened blackberries with a hint of creme anglaise on top.

This wine has a lot of bite. Basil and blackberries are the flavors that rise to the top and combined, they make me think of a stir-fry. It's an intriguing flavor combination, which raises it just above an olive rating.
