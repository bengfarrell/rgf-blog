**Alexander Valley Rendition Zinfandel 2009** Sonoma Country, CA

Strawberry and nectarine simmered with nutmeg are the most prominent smells from this leathery red wine. It smells sharp, full-bodied, and young.  Strawberry remains when drinking it, but the spice is more akin to allspice. It tastes a lot lighter than it smells, and eucalyptus and brown sugar add extra complexity.

It was a nice wine, if a little mysterious in flavor combinations. Yes, I call wines mysterious. You aren’t used to this by now?

> The flavor seemed on par with what I expect paint remover to taste.  It was very harsh, totally lacking any subtly and any detectable positive flavor.  There was absolutely no enjoyment from sipping this backward, off “wine.”  Two Buck Chuck is a step up from this rasp drippings.

> A nice, juicy zin with plenty of red and blackberry fruit and a hint of Chinese white pepper. Not a bit alcoholic fruit soup, but plenty ripe for non-zin freaks.

> Nice, dark, chalky fruit and quite dry.  Easy drinking, but I wasn’t making me taste it if you know what I mean.
