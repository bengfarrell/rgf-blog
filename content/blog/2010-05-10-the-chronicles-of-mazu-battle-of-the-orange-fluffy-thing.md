It's kitten picture time! At least we're still calling Mazu a kitten, even though she's up to 10 months now and has enough fur to convince us she's much larger than she is. It's pretty impossible to deny that she's a Maine Coon anymore---heck, I'm not sure if she's got any of her calico mother in there at all!

But back to the battle. Please enjoy these pictures of Mazu engaged in a fierce war, so fierce that focusing was nearly impossible. What better way to start your Monday than with kitten adorableness? (I may have a sickness, I know).
