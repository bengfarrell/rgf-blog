I headed out to Albany for the first time to check another café off my [East Bay Indie Coffee Passpor](http://thegourmez.com/tag/indie-coffee-passport/)t. I met up with a new friend and fellow UCSC alum who was excited to show me around her neck of the woods, which means you’ll be getting another Albany review from me soon. Four Corners is where we started, and it’s a neighborhood coffeeshop that recognizes the value of the wireless worker.

Outlets abound across its two window-facing bars (not pictured), and Wi-Fi is available. On a Thursday afternoon, it was maybe a quarter full, but it seems to do a good amount of to-go business, which their website reflects as it’s set-up more for online ordering than café description. They have classic sandwich, wrap, and salad offerings such as Philly cheesesteaks, BLTs, and egg salads that should please the typical hungry American. Breakfast looks to be their specialty with veggies scrambles, burritos, and an intriguing range of bacon, egg, and cheese options. I was there for lunch, though, and I was completely happy with the spicy turkey avocado wrap.

Crisp lettuce, plenty of avocado, and a satisfying crunch from grilled tortilla made for a nice lunch. I really enjoyed their Vietnamese iced coffee, not a typical coffeehouse offering.

Plenty of flavor with none of the pastiness that comes from the canned varieties, which gives me confidence in its freshness. At $2.60 for a small, it’s a good deal, too.

Four Corners Café isn’t reinventing the espresso machine, but it’s providing the quality of fare, drink, and space that makes a coffeehouse clinger like myself content for the afternoon.
