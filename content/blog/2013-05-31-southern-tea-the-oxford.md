Because I am not a sweet tea fan, it may surprise you that I order cocktails that feature it anyhow. But in cocktails, you see, a little sugar never hurt. Okay, it sometimes hurts, but that’s not the case for the Oxford’s Southern Tea. It’s made with Southern Comfort, spiced rum, peach liqueur, lemon juice, and that sweet tea.

The alcohol counteracts the tea’s sweetness, even with the also-sweet SoCo and peach schnapps involved. The rum flavor could be stronger, and adding something to contrast with the drink’s smoothness, like ginger, would take it to the next level of drinkability—yeah, that’s probably not a word, but I’m keeping it. As is, this Southern Tea improves on sweet tea and makes for a pleasant end to an evening.
