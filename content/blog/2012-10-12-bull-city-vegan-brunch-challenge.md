Much like the first, several Durham restaurants have agreed to come up with one vegan dish to compete for the votes of diners who try them out. This time, they’ve moved away from dinner and dessert and are doing brunch! Brunch without eggs, dairy, or meat? I’m intrigued!

There are a few additional rules the participating chefs must follow to avoid falling into the trap of presenting a standard vegan restaurant meal:

 

- Each entry must have both a sweet and savory component.
- Salad and lentil dishes cannot be considered brunch.
- Oatmeal, granola, hash browns, and fruit plates are off the table, so to speak.

I think that’s a pretty tall order to fill for a vegan brunch dish! Luckily, each of the participating restaurants are already serving their dishes, and here they are, along with the times that you can expect to find them offered—brunch is served at different hours at each location.

Those photos and descriptions all come from the Bull City Vegan Brunch Challenge’s website [here](http://globalveganchefchallenge.com/durham-nc-2012/). If you decide to participate and check out the options, voting takes place [here](http://globalveganchefchallenge.com/durham-nc-2012-vote/), although the voting doesn’t open for another day or two. Once the polls do open, they will stay that way through 10/31, and every voter will also be entered to win a prize package.
