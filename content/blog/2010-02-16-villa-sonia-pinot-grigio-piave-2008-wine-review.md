**Region:** Trevino, Italy

The Villa Sonia Pinot Grigio Piave 2008 has very little color, which fits as it also has very little body.  There was no smell I could discern. The tanginess hits you first, followed by a very light melon flavor, perhaps casaba. As the tanginess comes back, the flavor becomes staunchly that of star fruit. Sugar seems to settle down at the end of each sip.

While it's an interesting ride, the wine is pretty meh.

This Pinot Grigio reminded me of Carlo Rossi French Colombard that my under-age friends and I used to guzzle in high school, the daze when taste was secondary to quantity.  The Villa Sonia was very dry with little fruit character and I thought the finish was watery.  I really tried to like this wine and, with each grimacing sip, I searched and re-searched looking for a hint of some kind of fruit.  Even if this wine were three bucks, I still wouldn't buy it again... **No Thank You.**

_Jon:_ **Mediocre**

Light and crisp... I guess. There's not much flavor to talk about. It tastes like a glass of ice water. A little bit of alcohol does a quick dance on the front of your tongue then an iron-y (as opposed to irony) minerality kicks in after you swallow. But there is really no distinct flavor to this bottle. It's bland.

_Ted:_ **Buy**

This is a light and refreshing Pinot Grigio. There is a hint of floral and fruit aromas, that lead up to a light body with a crisp, clean acidic finish. This wine is going to be great just by itself, cooling you off on a warm summers' eve. Or enjoy it with some light pasta or fish dishes.
