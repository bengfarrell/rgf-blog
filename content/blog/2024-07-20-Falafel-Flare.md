# The Falafel Flare Basics

*Vibe:* This is a fast casual gyro and kebabs joint offering wraps, platters, salad, and various pizzas. There are burgers, too! Which means they are aiming to please the palates of groups with many different cravings. Order at the counter or use their ordering machine right by the register. Then grab a spot at any of their plentiful tables. It’s a clean, modern eatery.

Interestingly, this place used to be called Falafel Flame. The front door had the “m” peeled away, which is now replaced by an “R”. I want the 411 on that situation! It made me laugh to see the obvious change.

# My Falafel Flare Take

*Food:* I ordered a falafel wrap for my meal, with a sparkling water to drink. I’ve been on a falafel dry spell, and by dry spell, I mean every single one I’ve tried in *years* has been hella dry. Not so at Falafel Flare! The falafel were soft and the herbs inside them combined with the chickpea meal to create a nice, balanced flavor. I dug the pickled radish in the wrap and wish they’d included more! My only complaint is that the flavors were a bit tame, so I’d definitely recommend asking for the hot sauce, too—and more radish!

We’ve also had takeout a few times from Falafel Flare. Hamburgers are solid, and my husband keeps ordering lamb platters without me . . . so I think we’re regulars now.

*Would I Go Back?* For sure!
