**Lemontini** The Oxford ([My Review](http://www.thegourmez.com/2009/09/restaurant-review-the-oxford-downtown-raleigh/)) Downtown Raleigh $9

The lemontini at the Oxford is made with Absolut citron, limoncello, champagne, and ­sour mix. It wants to be a sophisticated take on the lemon drop, but I must give the lemon drop the edge because this lemontini does not have enough sour citrus to give it the depth I demand from a drink. The earthy and floral champagne notes peak my interest, but they dilute the lemon tartness that should star.

It goes down too easily to rise high in my rankings.
