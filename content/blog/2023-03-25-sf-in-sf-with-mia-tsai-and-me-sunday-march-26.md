Don't forgot! Tomorrow, I appear at [SF in SF](http://www.sfinsf.org/) for the second time, to celebrate Wings Unfurled! This reading series takes place on **Sunday, March 26, at 6:30pm** at the [American Bookbinders Museum](https://bookbindersmuseum.org/) in San Francisco. There's a $10 entry fee, but no one is turned away for lack of funds.

After our readings, Cliff Winning will interview me and fellow guest, Mia Tsai, who's promoting her paranormal debut _Bitter Medicine_. We’ll be taking questions from the audience as well, and [Soma FM](https://somafm.com/about/) will be recording the event for their station. Come grab a seat and ask me whatever you’d like. Even what my characters would pick as their favorite cocktails. 🍹 All proceeds from the $10 entry fee and the cash bar are donated to the [American Bookbinders Museum](https://bookbindersmuseum.org/).

See you there!
