**Wine:  Snapping Turtle Merlot 2007** Region:  Monterey, CA

This smooth, full wine smelled of pipe tobacco and curry leaves.  It tasted of plum with a bite.  The tobacco was also present while sipping.  Strange, but surprisingly appealing as there was also a note of Dijon mustard.  Overall, a pleasant wine.
