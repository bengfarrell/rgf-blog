**Wine:** Snapping Turtle Chardonnay 2007 **Region:** California

I popped this one open to simmer some risotto in it.  It tasted like lemon meringue pie, though not as tart. When cold, it seemed dry but got sweeter as it warmed to room temperature. There was some green apple peel in the mix as well.  It was a very mild, simple wine. And that risotto? Pretty tasty.
