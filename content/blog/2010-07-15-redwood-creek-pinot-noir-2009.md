**Redwood Creek Pinot Noir 2009** Modesto, California, bottling of French grapes

This pinot has a nose of blueberry, teriyaki, vanilla, and cardamom, and even though I don't like blueberries, it smells like it'd be a great sauce for duck or a thick steak.

When sipping, the element of spice is the most pronounced. The cardamom is present, and cinnamon mixes in, too. It actually has a pasty mouthfeel similar to when you mix spices into liquid. It's fairly thick-bodied;  I'd almost call it chunky. Blueberry is the strongest fruit note, and I'm amazed that it doesn't taste gross to me--I am not a fan of blueberries, so maybe the key is for me to try them with cardamom?

Redwood Creek Pinot Noir 2009 is a great wine from yet another Californian region that I hadn't tasted any wines from before.

[Adventures in $9 Wines](http://www.ninebuckwines.com/2009/12/2008-redwood-creek-pinot-noir.html) on the 2008 vintage

This wine is light, with classic cherry tones and low tannins- it must have been aged on some oak (and I would argue American red oak rather than French white oak), but you can taste just a hint of French heritage when you realize there is low acid and none of the earthy tones usually found in California Pinots. Its nose is light, with, again, black cherry tones predominant over light tastes of citron and a touch of ginger. The aftertaste is very smooth, gentle and lightly jammy; it only lasts for a few seconds. It has a lot more viscosity than I would have expected, but with a lower alcohol level and low acid, it builds nicely.

This is a great, all-purpose red, definitely goes down smooth with no bitter taste.  I would definitely purchase this one again and you can't beat the price!

[Good juice. Bad juice](http://goodjuicebadjuice.com/wordpress/?p=378). on the 2007 vintage

For the budget conscious wine drinker, this red juice is a solid choice. With a subtle spice that does not overpower, this wine was affordable AND enjoyable, the two very things I look for in a wine. More on the earthy side than anything else, but there are slight hints of dark berry/cherry flavors in the finish. A respectable amount of tannins round out this juice and could definitely hold its own with a wide range of foods.
