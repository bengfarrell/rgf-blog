Peppers is a breakfast and lunch spot with a few shelves of local art and goods. They offer soups, salads, sandwiches, and muffins. Their meats are roasted in house, and their bread is from local bakeries. I love how the shop is bathed with light from the window walls, and the muted green, creams, and wood offer a clean, fresh feel.

Beer, wine, smoothies, and Boylan sodas are available. There’s quite the range of sandwiches, from roast beef and brie to pork loin sandwiches with chunky apple spreads to citrus salmon. I went for the BBQ Mahi Mahi with jalapeno coleslaw.

The sandwich was enjoyable, with its sweet vinegar sauce, crisp lettuce, good tomatoes, and soft ciabetta. Somehow, the cheddar didn’t make it onto the sandwich, but I don’t think it needed it. The fish was fluffy and scrumptious, and the size of the sandwich was just right---if you haven’t noticed, I don’t like paying for more than I can eat.

It seems that sauces are a definite strong suit for Peppers, as my friend who lives nearby said and my sandwich evidenced. I also appreciated having a pepperoncini rather than a pickle for garnish. If you’re a regular reader of this blog, you know I can’t resist a bit of heat with my food.
