Lambrusco Dell 'Emilia Bianco Le Grotte Emilia-Romagne, Italy

![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/gourmez/photos/lambruscosparklingwhite.jpg)

This sparkling white wine, with a very pretty label if I do so say myself, smells of kiwi, guava, and ume fruit. That nose promises more fruit than it delivers on. What it does have in plenty is sugar; I would call it a dessert wine though it's not marketed as such. The bubbles seem quite large as they burst on my tongue, which is fun. The fruit on drinking it is closer to an overly ripe pear with a light suggestion of lime and peach.

It's not bad, but much sweeter than I like my whites.

What this Lambrusco brings to the nose is hints of sweet smelling Acacia flowers and lychee fruit, this is a wonderful smelling bottle of wine. But as happy as I was with the nose I was even more impressed with the taste. This wine held within its grasp lychee fruit, which translated beautifully from the nose to the mouth, also on the mid palate a hint of orange peel and floral aspects meshed together very well. You add the variables of lychee, flowers, orange peel and pair it with the high and light acid, and this recipe brings my taste buds to life like Frankenstein. This is a beautifully executed sparkling wine which at that price point of 4.00 dollars, yes I said 4.00 dollars, it's an absolute steal.

. . . like it's red-headed cousin, this wine is delicious. strong honey sweetness, fig, kiwi, tart apple and a solid kirsch component on the nose. the color is nice and clear and the bubbles are finer than . . . well finer than big bubbles i guess. because of it's lack of tanic bite and overt sweetness, i thought it best served very cold . . .
