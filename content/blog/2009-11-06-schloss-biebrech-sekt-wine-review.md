Wine: **Schloss Biebrich Sekt** Region: Germany

![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/gourmez/photos/schloss.jpg)

This sparkling wine is light gold, nearing opaqueness.  It has a smooth feel going down.  The bubbles tease more than assault (I'm not a big carbonation fan). It tastes pleasant, with a floral note beneath its mild orange flavor.  It is sweet, simple, and appealing.

> Bright and floral, this wine was almost as translucent and colorless as water. It had a modest apple aroma, and when the wine was poured in the glass there was an alarming amount of froth (ok, mousse for the geeks out there). Usually wines with lots of froth/mousse the bubbles are big and harsh, but the Schloss Biebrich bubbles were smooth and small. On the palate, there wasn't a harsh or bitter note, just warm pears flavors and a lingering impression of flowers on the finish.

> The color on this one is very light...could I guess a color? Almost clear, I guess I would say platinum. Subdued at first on the nose, then crisp white fruit aromas appear, seems to be mostly pear with hints of apples and peaches. Doesn't look to bubbly in the glass but seems to be popping in the mouth. The palate starts full and rich, towards the middle the bubbles kick in full force. I mean more bubbles than I have ever experienced.  The finish is light and crisp, a hint tart almost similar to a Sauvignon Blanc. This was not overly sweet, like some German Rieslings, which is what I was expecting. An excellent value!
