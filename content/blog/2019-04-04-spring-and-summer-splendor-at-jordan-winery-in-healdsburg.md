Jordan Vineyard & Winery has an impressive array of events lined up for the spring and summer of 2019. I've only visited the Healdsburg-based estate once, for their [caviar and cabernet sauvignon tasting seminar](https://thegourmez.com/2018/08/27/caviar-cabernet-sauvignon-jordan-winery-pairing/) during the 2017 Wine Bloggers Conference. But I've visited their chardonnays, cabernets, and sparkling wines many times in the glass.

Always, those wines provide exceptional examples of the quality that can be achieved when a winery focuses on what it does best. And hospitality is part of what Jordan Winery does best.

With so many opportunities to enjoy the beauty and splendor of the Jordan estate coming up, I thought I'd highlight a few of them for you. Now that we're back to sunshine in the Golden State for spring and summer, outdoor dining is back in!

\--**Spring Vineyard Hikes** on 4/26, 4/27, 5/10, and 5/11: Hiking is a new activity being offered at Jordan for people who like to work, just a little bit, for their wine. The half-day experience begins with a continental breakfast at the winery chalet. A four-mile hike commences through the vistas that make up the Jordan property, including the chef's gardens, vineyards, and olive orchards.

A charcuterie picnic and wine tasting awaits to celebrate your achievement at the end of the journey. [Tickets available here.](https://www.jordanwinery.com/events/spring-vineyard-hike) $110 per person.

**\--**Saturday, June 15, will be the first **Picnic Day** at Jordan! A splash of the Jordan Cuvée by Champagne AR Lenoble will send you on your way for this afternoon event. You'll continue with a short stroll overlooking Jordan's newest vineyard. An upscale picnic will then commence, with a lineup of gourmet food items made on the property, including salumi produced from a new partnership between Jordan and [Journeyman Meat Co.](https://journeymanmeat.com/) of Sonoma.

Each pair of guests receives a bottle of Jordan Chardonnay, and tastes of their cabernet sauvignon will also be available. [Tickets go on sale here on 5/22](https://www.jordanwinery.com/events/picnic-lunch-jordan-winery). More picnic days will come in the summer! $95 per person.

**\--**If you'd like a tasting experience more focused on Jordan's delicious cabernets than chardonnay, but still with the opportunities to learn about the newest vineyard and pair wines with Journeyman's charcuterie, the more affordable **Chateau Block tastings** will soon start taking reservations as well. The first will be 6/21, and they will be held every weekend into the fall. [Check here](https://www.jordanwinery.com/visit/tours-and-tastings/chateau-block-outdoor-wine-tasting) for more information and to make a reservation. $75 per person.

Make sure to [check out all the events](https://www.jordanwinery.com/events/calendar) coming up at Jordan Winery, and especially make note of the [Bastille Day Brunch,](https://www.jordanwinery.com/rewards/bastille-day-dinner) a rare occurrence that won't happen again until the next time Sunday and 7/14 meet. All of Jordan's events seem to sell out fast, and many will take advantage of the redecorated dining room at the winery chalet.

I've never dined in that room before, but I can tell you that the new design scheme aligns perfectly with my love of interiors that incorporate natural materials while maintaining gothic intrigue and sultriness. Or as Jordan's executive chef, Todd Knoll, put it, "The new design has brought drama, elegance and mystery to the space."

I sincerely hope my calendar clears up enough during these coming seasons to drink in that dining room's ambience…while drinking in more Jordan Cabernet, of course. May you have the opportunity to do the same this spring and summer in Healdsburg!
