**Twin Fin** Other words on the label: 2004 Pinot Grigio, California

Taste: Overall, the taste is a bit watery thin with a sharp undertone. There's definitely a presence of slightly browned green apples. You can taste it in the texture of a sip as well. I also taste underlying grapefruit, not to too tart, with a tinge of basil to accent.

Color: The wine is a light gold, probably as close to white gold as you can get without thinking its silver. It's similar to the understated gold in a pear's meat; it looks white but there's a definite presence of melanin. It also sparkles pleasantly in the light.

Smell-Nothing stands out here. I can barely smell a thing.

This is a pleasant wine, palate cleansing, but doesn't leave a mark.
