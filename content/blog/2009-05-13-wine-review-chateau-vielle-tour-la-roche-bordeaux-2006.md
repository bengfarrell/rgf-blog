**Other words on the label:** Grand Vin de Bordeaux, appellation Bordeaux controlee, EARL Vignobles LABONNE, proprietaire a F33790 MASSUGAS, Mis en Bouteille au Chateau, Produit de France.  There's also the certification of the French agriculture department but my brain was too tired to type it out.

This Bordeaux, which is the first bottle of Bordeaux that I've bought, is delightful on first sip with velvety, smooth fruit that reminds me of when I used to love raspberry-flavored anything above all other fruits.  I didn't get much off the nose but that's okay.  There were also some light elements of tobacco and dirt.  Overall?  Lovely.
