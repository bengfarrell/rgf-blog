*Obligatory Disclaimer:* I received these 2017 vintages from [Sosie Wine](https://www.sosiewines.com/)’s as free samples to review on this blog.

Sosie Wines has a tasting room on the main Square in Sonoma, and they are a French-inspired winery that uses sustainable and organic vineyards.

# Thoughts on Tasting the 2017 Sosie Red Blend

*Would I drink it again?* Yes!

*At this $45 price?* Because it’s so unique, I’m going with yes.

*Most memorable flavors and aromas?* A sweet raspberry and licorice candy nose made the first sip more tannic than expected in contrast with the earthy flavors in the glass. That tannin is expected with a wine grown at an elevation of 2,000 ft. as this one is. Very ripe raspberry invites a longer sip, which leads to bamboo shoots with a hint of almond, lots of pepper, and tart cherries. The wine mellows with time and gets some guava added to the mix.

*Image conjured up?* An interesting meal served on the beach at an all-inclusive resort.

# The 2017 Sosie Pinot Noir

*Grapes:* Pinot Noir – Swan, Calera, and Pommard clones

*Vineyard:* Spring Hill Vineyard

*Region:* Sonoma Coast

*Age at Review?* 5 years

# Thoughts on Tasting the 2017 Sosie Pinot Noir

*Would I drink it again?* Yes!

*At this \$45 price?* I think so, but I’m wavering.

*Most memorable flavors and aromas?* Smells like grape taffy, but the flavors in the glass are more refined: fruit leather, curry leaf, and a bath of blueberry. Ends with an impression of crushed vanilla Necco wafers.

*What would I pair it with?* Pizza with a complex sauce.
