This sparkling wine has a thin-body and lots and lots of bubbles. It’s very refreshing with light flavors of green apple and a dash of something floral for good measure. There might be some orange mingling in it also.

It’s a simple wine but simply good, too.

. . .  this is a damn good sparkler at this price point.  Notes of apricot, tart granny smith apples, bread dough (the yeast flavor) and tiny, tiny bubbles make this a standout.  Nice floral note and a long finish.
