My friend Jason Burke had asked me to help him on his children's show spoof he was working on for his senior thesis at Emerson.  I was asked to draw some scenes that he would composite live actors over

The show took place in a treehouse - the exterior here:

And the interior here:

And yah, occasionally I'm not the best with perspective, but its a kids show, so I ran with the look!

Jason wanted to hit the whole consumerism angle, so we have "Chuckles" brand action figures on display:

And finally - la piece de resistance, "Chuckles" kids working a sweatshop to make the clothes:
