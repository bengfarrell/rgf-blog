**Big Fat Man** Nantucket Café Sutton Station Durham [www.nantucketcafeandgrill.com](http://www.nantucketcafeandgrill.com/)

This is a manhattan made with Woodford Reserve Bourbon and served with 4 cherries.  The Woodford Reserve came through loud and clear with just a touch of vermouth.  As I like the hard stuff but find drinking it straight to be a challenge, the cherries made it all go down perfectly.
