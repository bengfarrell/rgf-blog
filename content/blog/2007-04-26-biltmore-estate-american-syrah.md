**Other words on the label:** American Syrah

The nose is peppery, floral, and tart. Upon sipping, "is peppery" is revealed to be an understatement-no need to add any to your food! It's adventurous to drink and tickles your tongue. I think there's some sweetness to the wine, but I'm too overwhelmed by the pepper to really pick it out.

Just keep in mind that my opinion of the wine lowers with each sip, so unless you're a pepper fiend, you might want to pass.
