I hope it's been a pleasant Saturday for you so far, readers. This is just a quick note to let you know that I'll be participating in the Finger Lakes Wine Alliance's launch of their 2013 Reislings in a short 3 hours from now, from 7 to 9 PM EST, which is 4 to 6 PM PST for those of you West Coasters who can't do the math.

I'll be tasting along with the 50 other media members participating in this live social media event. You can find us in two places: at the hashtag for the event on Twitter, [#FLXRiesling](https://twitter.com/hashtag/flxriesling?f=realtime "Twitter link"), or over at the [Finger Lakes Fans' Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/fingerlakeswine "Finger Lakes Fans"). I'm going to try to keep an eye on the happenings both places, but Twitter's my social media forte, so you can definitely follow my thoughts there or in my own Twitter stream [@theGourmez](https://twitter.com/thegourmez "My Twitter stream").

What will I be tasting? Four different 2013 rieslings with an emphasis on dry offerings--and yes, these are wine samples provided free of charge (disclaimer!).

[![Fingerlakes_Rieslings_01small](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2014/09/Fingerlakes_Rieslings_01small.jpg)](http://www.thegourmez.com/2014/09/finger-lakes-20013-riesling-launch-live-on-twitter-and-facebook/fingerlakes_rieslings_01small/)

In case you can't make out the labels, from left to right we have Glenora Wine Cellars's 2013 Dry Riesling, Swedish Hill Winery's 2013 Riesling, Chateau LaFayette Reneau's 2013 Semi-Dry Riesling, and Hosmer Winery's 2013 Dry Riesling. They are currently chilling in my fridge, though I'm taking [Talk-A-Vino's advice](http://talk-a-vino.com/2014/09/16/riesling-oh-riesling-finger-lakes-riesling-deep-immersion-with-winechat/ "Talk-A-Vino on Rieslings.") to pour my glasses about an hour before the event begins to retain a slight chill and allow them to develop with some air.

This event is doubly, no, triple-ly exciting for me because I'll be attending next year's Wine Bloggers Conference located in the Finger Lakes (I won Quini's Grand Prize!) and I have very little experience with Finger Lakes wines in general. I admit to some reticence. Sweet wines have never been my favorites, and rieslings have a reputation for sweetness. The rieslings I've ranked above average ([Schloss Biebrech Sekt](http://www.thegourmez.com/2009/11/schloss-biebrech-sekt-wine-review/ "A sparkling riesling from Germany"), [Buitenverwachting Rhine](http://www.thegourmez.com/2010/03/buitenverwachting-rhine-riesling-2008-wine-review/ "A Sparkling Riesling from South Africa")) have been largely sparkling. And the last riesling I rated that well was four years ago ([Lindeman's Bin 75](http://www.thegourmez.com/2010/01/lindemans-bin-75-riesling-2008-wine-review/ "Wine Review"))!

But I'm always ready to be surprised, and that half the wines we're tasting are specifically cast as dry gives me hope. See you on the interwebs soon, fellow riesling explorers! I'll be sipping from my beautiful balcony facing the Bay. Okay, I can only see an inch of the Bay, but it's all part of setting the mood, right?
