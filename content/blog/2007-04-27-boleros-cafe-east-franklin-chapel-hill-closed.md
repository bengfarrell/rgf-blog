**Bolero's Cafe** \*CLOSED\* 1404 East Franklin Street Chapel Hill, NC Entrees $10--$15

Bolero's opened about six months ago, adding a Latin American option to Chapel Hill's food scene. It is beach-themed in decor, which is cozy for this Californian. There are a great many options on the menu but it is rather heavy on the beef. I would call a number of the dishes experimental, blending Cuban, nouveau American, and classic American styles.

Every table receives chips, salsa, and a creamy-speckled sauce that may have been made with sour cream. It was nice to have a second option to the chipotle style salsa---I prefer more kick in mine.

My dish was nothing to write home about as it was a bit bland but I'm interested to try more at another visit.
