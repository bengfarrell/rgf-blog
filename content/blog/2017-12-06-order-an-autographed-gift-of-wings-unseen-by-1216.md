Apologies for a brief diversion from food and drink for an announcement for my day job - fiction writing! We're only 20 days out from Christmas, and thus the time for gift giving is upon us! For $15, you can send a signed, personalized copy of my epic fantasy, _Wings Unseen_, to anyone you love - heck, it's cool if you send it to someone you only kind of like, too. ;)

$15 includes the book, and my signature and a personal message, filled out from your instructions on whom I should address that message too. It also includes shipping costs! What is _Wings Unseen_?

**This price is only available until 12/16**. After that, I won't be able to ship via media mail in time for Christmas. But I am happy to use a more expensive shipping option to get it to your loved one for opening under the tree!

How to order? You can contact me via direct message on [Facebook,](https://www.facebook.com/thegourmez) [Twitter,](https://twitter.com/thegourmez) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thegourmez/) or just email me at [becca@thegourmez.com](mailto:becca@thegourmez.com). We'll discuss payment and shipping methods - either Paypal, Square, or Venmo will work, and I am amenable to other shipping options, but the price will reflect those other options.

Or you can just order _Wings Unseen_ off Amazon! It's only $12 currently, which is a deal! But that doesn't include author signature...

Happy holidays, dear readers, eaters, friends, and family! To bring us back to the Gourmez, here's a picture of a delicious watermelon and balsamic vinegar amuse bouche from a recent feast [Brix Chick Liza](http://www.brixchicks.com/) threw to celebrate my book publication. I'd explain what it is....but that'd be a spoiler. ;)
