**Casillero del Diablo Reserve Chardonnay** Other words on the label: 2005 East Coast

Casillero del Diablo's labels tell a story of their vintner keeping a reserve stash in the devil's cellar. More sugary than an average chardonnay, it makes me wonder if the devil doesn't have a sweet tooth.

The nose brings to mind a ginger crème brulee, which I've certainly never seen on a menu. It's tantalizing; I'm not a big fan of ginger but if you develop this dessert, please let me know.

The dulcified taste is balanced out with a hint of lime, lest you think this is really for dessert. The citrus lingers on the roof of your mouth long after the wine has made its exit.
