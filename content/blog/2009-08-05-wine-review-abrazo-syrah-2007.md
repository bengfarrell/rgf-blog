At last I have found it: a Spanish wine that I despise.  I could not finish half a glass of this very puckery and bitter syrah.  I honestly thought it smelled of kitty litter and the taste was not much better.  There was a slight hint of raisin but that's all the fruit I could make out.  Don't drink it unless you like a challenge.
