I hate snow.  Sure, it's fun to lift your head to the first flakes of the winter but that excitement lasts me for, oh, say a day or two.  Which makes living in North Carolina perfect; in the three years we've lived here, this past year was the first one that brought any snow accumulation at all.  And that melted in a day or two, so I really didn't have time to complain.

is snow I relish.  One might call it flower petals, but for me, it's the delightful snow of spring and far superior to the real stuff.  As I watch the petals swirl outside my office window, I catch my breath.  It's beautiful.  I have no idea what type of flowering tree we have, I'm sure Virginia or Rachel will fill me in on that, but I do know that I love it and the layer of petal snow that it brings.

I don't even get annoyed when I track it inside.

My life will soon be surrounded by flowers and really, between that and my cats, it's all I need to feel content.  Yes, my husband rolls his eyes at how often I stop and say, "Oooo, pretty!" as we pass the garden on the way to the door.

The pansies planted last fall are doing quite well and I've had a few daffodils and hyacinth already bloom and fade away.  I can't wait until the tulips greet me through the layer of soft snowflakes above them.

Snow by any other name is twice as lovely as that wet, muddy, inconvenient stuff up North.
