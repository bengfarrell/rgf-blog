Today at WritingForums.com, I shared [questions that writers should consider when writing a series](https://www.writingforums.com/threads/rebecca-gomez-farrell-shares-questions-to-consider-when-writing-a-series.201362/).

These are questions I had to wrestle with while writing _Wings Unfurled_, and they may be slightly different questions than writers who intend from the get-go to write a series might consider. That's because _Wings Unseen_ was writtten as a standalone novel, so the writing process for a second book in the same world was a different one. But many of the questions are likely useful either way.

WritingForums.Com is quite a useful forum, too, and I was excited when they joined the _Wings Unfurled_ blog tour. They often come up when I'm searching for information on the industry or craft advice. I'm looking forward to finally starting an account with them and poking around. They do also organize manuscript critiques, which I point out because folks are ALWAYS asking for where to find critique.

I hope you pick up some tips from the post! Don't forget to also visit the Meerkat Press [_Wings Unfurled_ Blog Tour masterpost](https://meerkatpress.com/wings-unfurled-blog-tour-giveaway/) to enter our $50 giftcard prize drawing! And now for today’s contextless quote from _Wings Unfurled_.

And now, for today's context-free quote from the book:

> “Listen to your father,” the specter said, billowing like a sheet of pressed metal in decay.
