Wine: **Masciarelli Montepulciano d'Abruzzo 2006** Region: Italy

Leather says hello as I take a whiff of this wine. There's a dark, rich cherry smell as well.   It tastes strongly of leather and leaves me with an impression of a smoke-filled car. It's very dry and somewhat sour, sucking away the moisture in my mouth and leaving me with a sharp tang of dried cherries.

an excellent food wine that sells for about $10 a bottle, this has a nose of black cherry, leather and earth. the palate was young and a bit tight but opened nicely with flavors of cherry and tobacco, with some floral notes of violets and nice, long finish. i would recommend picking up a couple bottles at this price. a nice, every day red.
