**Santa Cristina Sangiovese 2005** Other words on the label: Antinori and Toscana

This wine is actually a sangiovese and merlot blend, though it's very light on the merlot side. Just thought I'd be honest since their front label isn't quite!

The nose is a mix of vanilla and cedar.

You can definitely taste the time spent in oak on this wine. It starts out with a bit of candied date and blueberry but the oak quickly takes over. It is smooth, vibrant, and very woodsy.
