Awhile back, I had an idea for a comic strip, which turned into an animation, which turned into too big of a project as I went crazy on it as I wrote scripts, turned the characters into 3D models, etc.

The idea was Mr. Bland.  Basically an anti-hero but with heroic ancestry who try to get this boring guy to live up to his bloodline.

Here is the main character with his titular line "Danger is his mother's maiden name"![mr.-bland-sketch](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mr.-bland-sketch.jpg)

 

Here's a group shot of all the main characters:![mr.-bland-characters_final](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mr.-bland-characters_final.jpg)

Here's my original pencil sketches that I scanned in.  I later traced the images and converted them to vector through Adobe Illustrator.

Someday, I'd love to bring this back as a SIMPLE comic strip/graphic novel so I can actually finish a storyline!
