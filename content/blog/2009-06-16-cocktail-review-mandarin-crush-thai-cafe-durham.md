The Mandarin Crush is a cherry brandy cocktail served in a martini glass with two cherries at the bottom.  It resembles a golden and pink-tinged sunset, which certainly set me up to enjoy its flavors.

And enjoy it I did.  The cocktail is mildly sweet with a bite from the brandy that I quite appreciated.  It was the ideal amount of orange and cherry to combine with a hearty brandy.  Will drink again, with pleasure.

The restaurant review will follow tomorrow!
