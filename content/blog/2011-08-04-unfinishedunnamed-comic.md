Some time ago, I joined a "Subversive Humor" meetup.  I think that's what it was.  Anyway, the organizer and I started working on a comic strip about a web startup company that went under.  The owner of the company inherited a tobacco plantation in the south, so picked up and moved from NYC to NC.

I started with some pencil sketches, and eventually brought them into Adobe Illustrator as 2D line drawings.  I eventually fleshed them out to a more 3D look using gradient meshes.
