**Flirtini [West 94th Street Pub](http://west94stpub.com/) Woodcroft Shopping Center Durham**

This cocktail came with an unappealing pink film on top, but that is often the case for drinks made with crème de anything.  This one was crème de banane and its compatriots in the martini glass were watermelon pucker and vodka.  I tend to stay away from drinks with pucker and the plasticky sugar they bring, but this one was great for the mood I was in, hanging with friends and trying to guess the tunes on Name that Tune night.  It was fun, fruity, and had just the right amount of banana.
