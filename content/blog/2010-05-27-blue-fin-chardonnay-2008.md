**Blue Fin Chardonnay 2008** Napa, California

![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/gourmez/photos/bluefinchard.JPG)

This wine is bland on first sip, but then a note of eucalyptus chimes in. It's just a fleeting note, though, so bland still wins the day for me. It might be a stretch, but I think I taste pineapple and light brown sugar. It's quite sweet for a chardonnay and close to syrupy in texture.

It's not a bad wine, but certainly doesn't tickle my taste buds.

After the enjoyable [Green Fin](http://eatwellandprosper.blogspot.com/2010/03/wine-of-week-green-fin-2009-table-white.html), I wanted to check out the Blue. This is a very dry wine with spicy tones. The palest wine I've ever seen. Light and airy. Hints of green olive.

With the wine in the glass I was greeted with a bouquet of nectarines. On the palate the wine was fresh and crisp. At this end of the price scale the only oak you get is toasted chips which they thankfully passed on for this offering. The palate is filled with white apple flavors leading to a steely balance on the finish. This one brings an old saying to mind; "Simple is as simple does." Chalk this one up as a surprise, a nice, easy going picnic wine.

I have to say though that the Blue Fin was quite enjoyable. The oak was definitely present, but was very nice balanced with the fruit characteristics. I was also surprised by the acidity that sneaks up on the back-end - surprised, but pleased. The body of the wine was full enough to pair well with food, but I'm perfectly happy sipping this wine on its own.
