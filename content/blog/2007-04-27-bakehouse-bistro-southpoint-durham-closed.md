**Bakehouse Bistro** \*CLOSED\* Southpoint 6905-104 Fayetteville Road Durham, NC www.bakehousebistro.com Entrees $12--$20

Bakehouse Bistro is a new concept in dining, offering a walk-up counter, baked goods, coffee drinks, and a dining room. Like me, they are still working out the kinks of gourmet stardom, which probably endears me to the place more than I should let it.

The dining room is a lovely mix of maroon and black decor. Their large wall is covered with instructions on how to taste wine; obviously, they did this just to give me tips. They do hold wine tastings on Saturdays from 2--4 pm but so does the World Market across the way.

The star of the food selection is Bakehouse Bistro's fluffy flat bead. It's faintly sweet and quite addicting. The menu allows you to choose from a selection of sides, which I appreciate after saying no to so many entrees contaminated with a mushroom pairing. You can also substitute any of their small salads for no extra price, not that I'd recommend the one we tried--they used iceberg.

I loved my side of (strong on the) garlic-mashed potatoes but the roasted vegetables were rather bland as was my sandwich choice.

I went back for breakfast recently and I can highly recommend the omelettes. It was light and fluffy and I think the coffee service has improved but not by much-all drinks are still served in a 20 oz. to go cup, including my double short cappuccino.
