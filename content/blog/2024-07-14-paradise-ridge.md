# The 411 on Paradise Ridge Winery

The Paradise Ridge Winery and vineyards have been in the Dutch Byck family since 1978. It’s a sprawling estate, with a newly remodeled tasting room to take full advantage of the sunsets they receive over the city of Santa Rosa. 

Why newly remodeled? The estate took extensive damage in the 2017 fires that swept through much of Sonoma County. I had not been to Paradise Ridge before the fire, but I can attest that it is a wonderful place to visit, and beyond talking with employees about the difficulty bouncing back from that tragedy, I would never have know it took place.

In addition to tastings and many special events at the winery (sunset music nights, murder mysteries,) you must plan in time to explore the grounds. You can walk on trails between all the scultpures or take your car, but don’t miss this chance to soak in such amazing art. I’d take at least an hour to do so properly. And it provides a lovely full-circle feeling, knowing that the family matriarch and patriarch became engaged in a sculpture garden in the Netherlands over half a century ago.

# My Take on Paradise Ridge Winery

*The Vibe:* This is a winery that knows how to host guests! It’s clear that hospitality is a real focus of their business; they want to share their wines and their estate with the world. Check-in was efficient, and there were several types of tastings to choose from. Plus, it’s a delight when you get to step onto their porch and into the bright, beautiful sun with a view of Santa Rosa.

*The Wine:* I tried five wines on my visit. Each one was quite unique, even the 2018 and 2019 Pinot Noirs. The 2019 tasted similar to a linzer cookie with strawberry jam, making it the party Pinot, in my humble opinion. While the 2018 plunged down to the earth with rich, cool, clay vibes and a playful finish of tamarind.

The 2018 Convict Zinfandel pulled off the classic berry trio of rasp, blue, and straw. Each smooth sip was a pleasure, along with the slightest hint of vanilla.

The 2018 Cabernet Franc bought out bamboo tannins that made me yearn for a streamside retreat with beautifully sculped bonsai to contemplate—the sculpture garden was close enough! White pepper, bay leaf, and parsley also appeared, making me want to try it with a couscous and feta salad.

*The Grounds:* I’ve already talked about the sculptures onsite at Paradise Ridge Winery, and can you blame me? I had such a difficulty time not stopping for them on my way up to the tasting room. It’s a good thing I waited until after, though, because I would definitely have been distracted from my reservation! The LOVE sculpture by Laura Kimptom is iconic.

You don’t want to sleep on the mini-museum in the bottom floor of the tasting room, either. It chronicles the history of the first Japanese winemaker in California, Kanaye Nagasawa of Fountaingrove. Until the fires, the famous round barn he had built was a local landmark that stood for a hundred years. He was also the top wine producer in California during his time. Despite all that, Fountaingrove’s lands were still seized by the city of Santa Rosa after Nagasawa's death, due to the discriminatory laws of the time. The city refused to let the land be passed on to his children.

*Would I Go Back to Paradise Ridge Winery for a $35–45 tasting?* Considering that it includes visiting all that artwork, too?

 Absolutely . . . and maybe because entry to Paradise Ridge Winery's grounds to view the artwork is  free. So I don’t mind supporting that effort to keep them open by throwing in for a tasting fee.
