**Peter Brum Vino Noire** Rhone, Germany [![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/03/brutpinotnoir.jpg "brutpinotnoir")](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/03/brutpinotnoir.jpg) I haven’t tried too many red wines from Germany, so I was intrigued by this bottle and its unique shape—it really is all about marketing, folks. It smelled of strawberries and light tobacco. The first thing I noticed while drinking it was a small bit of fizziness, just enough to make you question your sanity. It’s thin-bodied, and the taste is very much strawberry juice, almost like a Kern’s Nectar but without the texture and with a little candy flavor. There’s some rhubarb also, or maybe I’m having a pie craving. Mild coffee rounds it out, and yes, now I am craving dessert with a cup of joe.

You know that feeling when you meet someone special, it’s all new and different and all you want to do is make-out and pretend everything else doesn't exist? I believe Violet and I found that equivalent in a wine . . . We love this wine. I mean love, love, **love** this wine . . . It's smooth, it's sweet, it's fruity - like cranberries, blueberries and raspberries all got mushed together. There's not a lot of acidity and the sweetness is mild enough that it's not overpowering to the point where you get sticky mouth after a few glasses.
