I am way behind on all my travel posts, but I’m hoping to get that taken care of in the next few weeks. Here’s one on a trip the husband and I took to High Point, NC, for the 35th Stellarcon. “Now old enough to run for president!” was the unofficial slogan. This was my third speculative fiction convention, and Ben’s first.

What did I think? It was fun! Stellarcon convinced me to sign up in large part because I was amazed that such a small conference offered so much programming. As an author, I’m most drawn to the panels on writing-related aspects that I need more guidance on, but I also really enjoyed the fan-based panels, though I only attended two. One was on love for New Who and the other was a celebration of that glorious genre called B-movies.

A sci-fi/fantasy convention, you say? Where are the crazy pictures? Well, since you asked . . .

Klingon Karaoke!

Apparently, this is a Stellarcon tradition, with a Klingon and an Enterprise crewwoman hosting the event. I sang a little No Doubt—pretty badly since I didn’t remember the verses to Spiderwebs. Sigh. Other singers had more success.

On Day 2, Ben and I went for a walk around High Point, as I’d never been there beyond stopping to take a picture there during the [Giant Furniture Adventur](https://thegourmez-wpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/07/index.jpg)e. I was surprised by many of the awesome buildings High Point has that are definitely worthy of a shot or two.

That evening, we headed to the costume competition, which is always a highlight for me of these events. Here were my favorite costumed competitors.
