**The Sting** The Hive Downtown Raleigh [Website](http://www.busybeeraleigh.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=80&Itemid=67)

If you have both a sweet and spicy tooth, as I do, this cocktail is fantastic.  It is made with passion fruit vodka, muddled jalapenos, honey, cilantro and something else I didn't write down.  The spiciness makes your throat tingle but the sweetness makes you forget all about it.   I'm not a fan of flavored vodkas generally, but passion fruit was an inspired choice for this mixture.  I couldn't taste the cilantro but it sure looked pretty floating around with the jalapeno rings.
