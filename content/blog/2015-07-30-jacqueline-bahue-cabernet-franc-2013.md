The nose gives off an impression of scents. It's an invitation to explore their potential. And on exploration, this is a beautifully integrated glass of wine. Elegant, a gracious hostess in pearls whose complex inner beauty lies just beneath her skin. My current love affair with cabernet franc gains another acolyte.

Other Winos’ Thoughts:

Rod, a [NakedWines.Com Archangel](https://us.nakedwines.com/wines/jacqueline-bahue-cabernet-franc-sonoma-county-2013.htm)

Wonderful deep purple in the decanter. Nose suggested cherry or plum. This wine was bold, rich, smooth & delicious. I had it with an extra-sharp Welsh cheddar; also, with a meatloaf and pepper-jack sandwich. All I can say is Wow, Jacqi did it again!

[The Reverse Wine Snob](http://www.reversewinesnob.com/2014/04/jacqueline-bahue-cabernet-franc.html) on the 2012

The 2012 Jacqueline Bahue Cabernet Franc begins with pleasant aromas of dark fruit (plums and prunes) along with a bit of mint and black pepper. There’s a hint of a “green” note on the nose that does not seem to carry over when tasting, which I was happy about. In the mouth the wine tastes smooth and dry with soft tannins. There’s more dark fruit but also some nice chocolate and coffee notes to balance it out. It gets even better after an hour or two in the glass so take your time with this one. It ends dry with a long and satisfying finish. Highly Recommended!

Justin at [My Kings Court](http://mykingscourt.com/2014/03/12/wine-review-2012-jacqueline-bahue-lodi-cabernet-franc/) on the 2012

Color – Bright Violet. Nose – Mocha and Dark Fruit. Taste – Black pepper (not as much as a VA Cab Franc) and chocolate with bold blackberries. Not jammy at all. Finish – Medium-Long with great mouthfeel. Overall, I was surprised by this young wine. It was very good first California Cabernet Franc and for the money you cannot beat this. Hopefully, this start up winemakers will open her own vineyard one day. Rating: A+
