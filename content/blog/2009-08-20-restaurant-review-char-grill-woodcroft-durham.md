Burgers and Sandwiches: $2–$4.80

Char-Grill is a Triangle chain that specializes in hamburgers, steak sandwiches, fries, and shakes at very affordable prices.  The location in Durham has lots of indoor and outdoor seating, black- and red-tiled walls, and oldies playing on the sound system.

You place your order on a long strip of paper, then slide it through a chute to the cooks.  When it's done, the cashier will call your name on the loudspeaker.  Hamburger prices include catsup, mayonnaise, chili, mustard, onions, pickles, lettuce, and tomatoes.  You can add on cheese, bacon, or coleslaw for a small additional price.

My Char-Burger was pretty tasty, especially with the gooey American cheese.  It's just not a good, old-fashioned cheeseburger without some processed cheese sticking to the back of your teeth.  This was a mid-sized burger, which is the right size for my appetite.

I did wish the buns were warmed, though. The fries were plain to my taste; I prefer either skinny fries or ones with seasoning salt.  These were lightly salted and thick.  They worked well for dipping in the shake, for those Wendy's Frosty dippers among us.

Speaking of the shake, my chocolate one was very good but make no mistake, this is a dessert, not a beverage-straws are no use here.  The light chocolate flavor tastes like cocoa.

I'd pick Char-Grill over the nearby fast food joints any day.  Ingredients taste fresher and the level of customization offered is great.
