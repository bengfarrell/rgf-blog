Once again, Katrina Rasbold, my fearless leader at [All My Writers](http://allmywriters.net) for the last, oh, almost decade, has released a Yearbook of this year's _General Hospital_ Fan Club Weekend. She writes the reports; I take the photos.

This 180-page book is jam-packed with full-color photos of _General Hospital_'s past and present-day stars from 4 days of events. There's plenty of behind-the-scenes gossip to boot. What'll you learn about in the Yearbook? As Katrina writes,

> New couples, new babies, famous spouses, Hollywood royalty, a bit of a smack-down from Executive Producer, Frank Valentini, a “Blast From the Past” actor with some very unconventional claims and advice to fans, two Rabbis, plenty of selfies, a double-helping of Michael Corinthos, a male heart-throb who broke all of our hearts on screen, a current GH couple who ditched us, graphic novels straight from ComiCon, impossible schedules, careers made and broken, dogs and cats living together... this year had it all! 

Our print copies of [last year's yearbook](the-general-hospital-fan-club-weekend-2013 "2013 GH Yearbook Info Page") sold out as soon as the doors to the main cast event opened, so you know these are beautiful keepsakes for the _GH_ fans among us. Both full-color and black and white paperback versions are available from Amazon.

Color:                      Black and White:

         

I couldn't leave you without sharing my favorite photos from the event, could I? I was so delighted to see Scott Clifton at the Past Cast Event. Him and Michael Sutton appearing made my weekend.

I hope you enjoy the 2014 Yearbook!
