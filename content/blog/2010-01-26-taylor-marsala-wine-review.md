**Wine:** Taylor Marsala **Region:** Finger Lakes, New York

The color of this dessert wine is fantastic. It's like looking at a blood red rose, with a copper hue around its edges.  It smells like port, with rich, dense, scents of overripe peach and tamarind.

The flavor is smooth and definitely has peach notes, but the tamarind I smelled is really closer to rhubarb, with sweet strawberry also. These fruits swim in the glass like they are in raw sugarcane or molasses syrup. It's much better than I expected for a staple of your grocery store's bottom shelf in the alcohol aisle. **Other Bloggers' Thoughts:**

Deeply golden, warm and fruity, Taylor Marsala is a classic flavor in gourmet cooking and a smooth satisfying dessert wine. It is a creamy, medium sweet marsala with raisin-like flavoring. A delicious gourmet touch in recipes or for sipping. Serve at room temperature.
