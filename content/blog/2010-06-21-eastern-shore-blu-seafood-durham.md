**Eastern Shore** Blu Seafood and Bar [Website](http://bluseafoodandbar.com/) [My restaurant review](http://www.thegourmez.com/?p=1326)

![](http://www.thegourmez.com/gourmez/photos/blu07.JPG)

Eastern Shore is made from Pimm's, lemon juice, cucumber slices, ginger-lemongrass syrup, and a splash of ginger ale. All of those flavors come together to create a vibrant cocktail that's worth your money. Interestingly, the cucumbers seemed to be only a garnish, but their flavor came through strongly in the drink, and I think they mellowed out some of the bolder flavors. Those other flavors melded very well together and made a tasty concoction that I'd definitely drink again.
