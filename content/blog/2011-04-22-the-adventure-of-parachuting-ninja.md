**The Adventure of Parachuting Ninja**

When my sister was in town a few weeks ago, we went to Wilmington and found ourselves with a pile of tickets from an afternoon at the boardwalk arcade. For our prize, we chose the parachuting ninja.

Awesomeness personified, am I right? And thus, I present to you the adventures of the Parachuting Ninja, a story told in photographs.

The adventure begins deep in the forest of mint, as Parachuting Ninja makes his way through the woods.

Once past the treacherous herbal forest, he finds his next obstacle, the giant Zygo Cactus. It’s a prickly enemy for any Parachuting Ninja, no matter how highly trained.

<!--more--> After battling barbs and vaguely tropical flower buds, the Ninja takes the time to pass by the black grid, the home of the Dreamcatcher Vase. Merely walking past it gives him the inner strength to continue his journey.

That fortitude comes in handy as he traverses the treacherous mandarin swamp. He crosses it with the aid of a metal netting, which he always keeps hidden inside his left shoe.

With all those obstacles behind him, the Parachute Ninja meets the greatest one of all: Giant Older Sister.

Within her clutches, he knows he has only one option—it’s time to jump for his life. And time for the narrator to include some dramatic action shots.

He reaches the great plain of Lawn safely and takes a moment to relish his escape.

But, oh, Parachuting Ninja has a fatal flaw: overconfidence. He waits too long and draws the attention of one of the great beasts of Lawn.

The creature sniffs and then decides she has more important things to investigate, like blades of grass blowing in the wind. The Parachuting Ninja takes a deep breath of release, amazed he survived such a close shave. But it’s a mistake. Faster than Parachuting Ninja can pull his dagger, another beast is upon him.

And it’s all over. None can survive the wrath of One-Eyed Loki. Parachuting Ninja was brave, fast, and sneaky, but even he could not challenge the great beasts of Lawn.

The End.
