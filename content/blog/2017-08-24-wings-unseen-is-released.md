_Wings Unseen,_ my debut epic fantasy novel, is now available at bookstores and libraries and everywhere online! Here's a perspective you don't see of the cover often, the full front and back:

If you'd like to see it in paperbackÂ near you, request to have _Wings Unseen_Â ordered at your favorite store. Such requests are much appreciated! And so are online orders. You can get it from any of these retailers in paperback or ebook forms:

I would absolutely love it if you would rate and/or review the book after reading as well - ratings are life for authors! We all know we are swayed by them. ;) So a big virtual hug from Mazu for those of you able to do so.

To celebrate the release of _Wings Unseen_Â yesterday, I thought I'd do a reading on Facebook Live...but I have a ton of _Wings Unseen_ readings coming up, so I thought it'd be more fun to share some of my earliest short stories instead. And by early, I meant second to fifth grade. You can watch the video by [clicking through](https://www.facebook.com/thegourmez/videos/vb.567409606/10154899503469607) to Facebook or click the video to play below:

Ah, elementary school storytelling. I was so precocious.
