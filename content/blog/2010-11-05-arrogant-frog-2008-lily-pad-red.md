The Lily Pad Red is a mix of cabernet sauvignon and merlot, both perfectly good wines for blending but I appreciate best on their own. It smells of beef jerky and cherries. The cherries are more prominent than expected when sipping.

There’s not much going on in this wine, but it’s pleasant.

[More than Merlot](http://www.morethanmerlot.com/2009/11/arrogant-frog-promotion/)

The Lily Pad Red was a little harsh at first, but once we let it breath a bit it was smooth and easy to drink.  I’d recommend this to anyone who enjoys Bordeaux but is looking for something a bit lighter.

Appealing for its dark, briary cherry and plum fruit, with earth, herbal and spicy vanilla notes.
