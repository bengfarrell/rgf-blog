[![The-Gourmez-Square-header](images/The-Gourmez-Square-header.jpg)W](http://thegourmez.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Gourmez-Square-header.jpg)hat happened to the delicious posts on this site? They've gone back home to _[the Gourmez!](http://thegourmez.com)_ In August 2013, when we moved to the Bay Area, I combined all my writing pursuits into the site you're viewing now. At the time, housing them together made the most sense for my sanity--too many sites to manage was too much in the midst of such a huge life change. But nearly two years later, and a recent transition from Hayward to Oakland where my reviews are suddenly in higher demand, meant it was time to give [_the Gourmez_](http://thegourmez.com) its proper focus again. And thus, that new-old site has been reborn!

My fiction and entertainment publication news and life updates will continue to be housed right here. But if your stomach starts growling or your wanderlust kicks in, [_the Gourmez_](http://thegourmez.com) is there for you.  In fact, if you click on the menu items above for food, drink, & travel, you'll find yourself transported to that website instead. Don't panic! Tastiness is only a mouse click away.

Meanwhile, I'll be doing more personal writing on this site--writing related to the writing life, that is. I've had a few requests to share my own struggles with searching for validation in a career where that rarely equals an income, so I'll dig into that topic soon. But mainly, I'm planning to re-focus my writing time and get more fiction under my belt. I'm currently shopping around two longish short stories and one fantasy novel. My second novel, a post-apocalyptic romance, is about two-thirds of the way through its first draft, and I have at least four other short stories in various stages of editing and initial plotting. Here's hoping they all find a home in time!
