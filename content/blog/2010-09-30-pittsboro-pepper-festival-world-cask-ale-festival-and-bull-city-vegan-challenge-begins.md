More foodie events! Seriously, folks, October is an absolutely ridiculous month for us food and drink lovers in the Triangle. First, the Bull City Vegan Challenge launches tomorrow. The official kickoff is Sunday at the Pinhook, during the monthly vegan brunch by the Fiction Kitchen. Throughout the month, you can dine on vegan dishes at Alivia's Durham Bistro, Beyu Caffe, Dos Perros, The Federal, Nosh, Parker and Otis, Rue Cler, Toast, Vin Rouge, and Piedmont. Hit any of them up and then vote your your favorite's at BCVC's website. They've posted [great pictures and descriptions](http://bullcityveganchallenge.com/competing-dishes) of each restaurant's dishes.

Next up on Sunday, the Abundance Foundation is hosting the [3rd Annual Amazing Pittsboro Pepper Festival](http://theabundancefoundation.org/pepper-festival) from 4 to 7 pm! Many of our local chefs and brewers are preparing pepper-based dishes and drinks for this one, including intriguing options such as an habanero beer from Triangle Brewing Company. 40 pepper varieties will be on hand for tasting and challenging your sweet and spicy taste buds, all grown sustainably by Doug Jones of Piedmont Biofarms, last year's farmer of the year per the Carolina Farm Stewardship Association. Holy Ghost Tent Revival will provide music. Tickets are $15 in advance at the website and $25 at the door. I really wish I could make this event, but I think my workload won't let me.

Finally, another event I can't make for a better reason called a vacation in London: the World Cask Ale Festival on 10/23 in Durham. It will be held from 6:30 to 11:00 pm at the Trotter building, and the $40 admission includes beer samples, a glass, and food. Ten local breweries are providing samples of their craft beers in traditional casks--next year, the organizers hope that they'll earn their "world" cred. The best information on this event is at [All About Beer Magazine.](http://allaboutbeer.com/wcaf/)

I love hearing about these events even when I can't come along. Let me know what you thought of them if you make any!
