**Chalone Vineyard** Other words on the label: Monterey County 2004 Chardonnay

This review may be skewed because everything tastes like grapefruit lately. Which means that grapefruit, of course, is the most prominent flavor in this wine. Extracting that acidity, here are the rest:

The nose is sweet with a hint of lime while first sip is quite herbalicious. Rosemary is the strongest herb but I detect a bit of basil and fennel as well. The wine is as sweet as its smell suggests but it has a bite, like looking at the nutrition label on a candy bar. All in all, its tastes like my father's favorite candy, Halvah.
