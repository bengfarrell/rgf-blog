**Screw Kappa Napa (S/K/N) Sauvignon Blanc 2007** Napa Valley, CA

First, I just have to say that I love the brand name _Screw Kappa Napa_. It's so much fun to say and seems wittier than it is, really, kind of like my nom de plume. Plus, the label has a pretty raised pattern that you might not be able to see in the picture, and I dig the fresh, clean design of their initials with slashes. Seriously, the little things do count. Or at least entertain.

The smell of this wine was all green apple. I could taste its peel on first sip, which gave way to more of a braised pear note, with vanilla cream and white cranberries.  It is mildly sweet, dry, and fleetingly tart.

This is a good, lingering white wine.

[Wine Witch](http://winewitch.net/wine-reviews/skn-sauvignon-blanc-2007-california-10-15/)

The 2007 SKN Sauvignon Blanc is a pale greenish gold in the glass.  The nose is pretty light, but if you really get into the glass you get melon and maybe some jasmine.  Despite the light nose, there is a lot going on in the glass - a veritable buffet of tropical fruits including mango and guava.  This Sauvignon Blanc has the acidity you would expect from this grape, but there is an almost Chardonnay like butter in there also.   This is not a sophisticated wine - it is all there on the first taste.
