**Other stuff on the label:** Chatham Hill, NC

The aroma was full of pepper and tobacco. This is a rare cabernet that is full-bodied, smooth, and also lacking acidity. It's warming to drink, which is very nice after spending 30 minutes waiting for the bus ride home. The wine's texture was visually present; grainy with a golden halo above the deep purple pool. Drinking it was like taking a bite out of a tomato that'd been roasted with pepper, basil, and rosemary. Delicious, if you like a little substance to your wine.
