Wine:  **Incanto Rose** Region:  Italy

![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/gourmez/photos/incanto1.jpg)

This sparkling rose has no nose to speak of.  It is moderately fizzy and paltry in personality.  I would liken it to a sparkling water with lemon-lime flavoring and a dash of berry.  It would work as a very light accompaniment for a meal but definitely not for drinking on its own.

**Wine Novice @ [The Wino That I Know](http://thewinothatiknow.blogspot.com/2008/08/incanto-rose.html)**

> There is a slight fuity aroma scent to this wine, but there is very little of a fruity taste. This is a very dry wine, and I was excited about the effervescent quality of it. It was actually overpowering and I think the wine would have been better whithout it. The hubs really seemed to enjoy this wine, but it's not my cup of tea.

> Rating: 1 Star...Might be nice if you prefer really dry wines, though.

> A mild nose, with just a bit of candied apple.
>
> This is a slightly carbonated wine - it has a regular cork that requires a corkscrew, but it makes a pop noise when you open it. There's no real stream of bubbles - just some hanging on the side of the glass. The bubbles give it a very interesting mouthfeel - it's not quite fizzy, but you definitely feel it. Red apple and a few toasty notes and that's it. If it didn't have the fizz, I'd probably call this quite boring but it adds a layer to make it interesting.

> I get some strawberry seeds on the finsh.

> This is an extremely simple wine - very little is going on - but the bubbles give it a bit of depth, and there's nothing funky or unpleasant going on. For this pricepoint, that's not bad at all.
