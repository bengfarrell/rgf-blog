**Monte Antico** Other words on the label: Toscano Indicazione Geografica Tipica Red Wine 2003 Sangiovese

The first sip was overwhelming earthy, by which I mean it tasted like dirt. After a few more swirls, I attributed the earthiness to mushrooms, leavened with the pith of a grapefruit.

This wine just didn't taste quite natural. The best approximation I can offer is that it left a residue in your mouth reminiscent of helium you've sucked out of a balloon. Or perhaps it's closer to the taste of chapstick, you know, after you've taken a chomp off the top. What, you didn't do that?

It's curious...too curious.
