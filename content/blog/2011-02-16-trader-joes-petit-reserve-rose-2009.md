**Trader Joe’s Petit Reserve Rose 2009** Napa Valley, CA

[![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/02/traderjoesrose.jpg "traderjoesrose")](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thegourmez-wpmedia/2011/02/traderjoesrose.jpg) It’s a gorgeous soft gold and pink rose color. Smells pleasingly of artificial raspberry flavoring—-this is not a bad smell; think of Chapstick or Fun Dips.

The wine’s taste, however, has almost no character whatsoever. It’s very thin-bodied. Raspberry and strawberry notes flee so fast you’ll forget them by the time the aftertaste tingles your tongue with its minerality. There’s a bit of a film, too. Stratch that---the more you drink, the filmier it gets.

This rose doesn’t provide anything of interest. Drink it because it’s there, not because it’s fun to.

Couldn’t find any! And I was so hoping for confirmation of my lackluster opinion.
