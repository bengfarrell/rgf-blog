Treasured Readers,

The site has been quieter than normal as I'm in the midst of re-categorizing posts so the food/drink/travel section is easier to navigate. Thus, you can now access any of those categories under the **Food/Drink/Travel** heading above or through the master page here:

[Click Me!](/food-blogging/)

I am halfway through the process of re-categorizing posts, so everything from 2011 to the present is listed in those pages. I'll be working on the 2007--2011 set over the next week. I believe I'm well over 2,000 posts at this point. That's a lot of food writing!

In other news, I now have a mailing list set up so I can e-mail you, treasured readers, whenever I have exciting publication news to share. That's roughly 3--4 times a year, so I can promise that I won't spam your mailboxes. If you're interested in getting news on that front delivered straight to you, then sign-up through the widget at the right or right below. They won't bite.

_Coming up_: Pink's of Hollywood! Barcelona's beautiful architecture and tasty tapas! San Francisco's Sutro Baths! More wine and absinthe! And the return of my camera from the shop! Yes, yes, that's another reason things have been a little quiet here. My trusty Rebel T3i is getting thoroughly cleaned up in the shop. It's as though I've lost a limb--well, a third limb that occasionally gives me neck pain from too much time spent together. Regardless, I miss you, pretty little camera!

Our reunion will come soon.
