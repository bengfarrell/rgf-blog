A year ago, I posted my [first review](http://www.thegourmez.com/?p=464) of William's Gourmet Kitchen, and I thought it was pretty good, definitely a step up from fast food, but nothing that made me crave running back there again.

They've added a lovely covered porch on the side of the building now.

I also decided it was time to give in to the red velvet cupcakes.

This was no gigantic cupcake, but the size of the ones that used to be considered normal, making it perfect for an afternoon dessert.

But it was moist, airy even, and had a good amount of cream cheese on top. So many cupcakes overwhelm with frosting amounts. I'd say this one had a better frosting to cake ratio per bite than most do.

Based on this experience, I'm raising William's Gourmet Kitchen to an
