Last month, [the Lodge at Tiburon](https://huzza.io/wineantics/live-stream/wine-antics-wbc16-livestream-3) invited me out to try their new brunch menu at the attached Tiburon Tavern, [which I loved](http://thegourmez.com/2016/07/06/new-brunch-and-chef-at-tiburon-tavern/). Because Ben's birthday fell on the same day, I thought, why not make it an overnight trip and stay at the hotel as well? They offered me a discounted media rate, which we jumped on for such an ideal location just two blocks from the shorefront.

The hotel turned out to be a great choice as it's the type of place that makes one feel truly relaxed and welcome due to its many thoughtful touches.

One of those touches, as seen in the picture above, is two outdoor gas fireplaces that guests can ask to have turned on anytime. One of them is on a rooftop deck, offering plenty of seating and views from all sides of the Tiburon Hills.

Surrounded by a wood wall, the Lodge's pool was made all the lovelier by the comfortably padded chaise lounges and two cabanas.

The pool temperature was slightly cooler than bathwater, and the spa maintained plenty of heat, even with the jets running fast. The Lodge also boasts conference rooms, a small gym, wireless Internet access, bike rentals, a free DVD movie library, and free parking. You can even bring pets, which is quite surprising for an upscale establishment like this one.

The most thoughtful touch the hotel employs is, in my opinion, in the people that it employs! From the front desk to the hotel manager on duty and my press contact, everyone we encountered felt truly happy to have us there, and they seemed to take a little extra enjoyment in knowing I was a blogger and it was Ben's birthday. We were upgraded to a residential king suite, and boy was it nice to have that couch to relax on and a very comfortable king bed in a separate room.

I loved the cool blues of the rooms and the dark wood furnishings. A complimentary cheese and wine plate greeted us upon opening the door, which we later enjoyed on the rooftop deck, huddled close to the fireplace in the chilly evening.

If you want to stretch your legs while at the hotel, the ground is full of appealing flowers. It's hard to go wrong no matter what path through the buildings you choose.

You'll be sure to stumble upon the restaurant's garden as well, which made me smile, knowing that at least some of the vegetables in that morning's brunch didn't travel far.

All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to return to the Lodge at Tiburon. It's positioned well for taking a ferry to Angel Island or for visiting nearby Sausalito if Tiburon itself isn't your destination. To be honest, for a quick trip, the hotel itself is destination enough.
