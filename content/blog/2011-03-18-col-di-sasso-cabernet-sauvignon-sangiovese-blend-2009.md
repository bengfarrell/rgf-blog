**Col di Sasso Cabernet Sauvignon & Sangiovese Blend 2009**

No photo this time! It was a casualty of my trigger finger.

It smells mildly of fig and tastes of fig, too, with plum notes also. Besides the healthy portion of fruit, it’s dry, leathery, a bit bitter, and abundant in allspice.  Overall, it was too leathery for me.

We found this wine overwhelmingly dry, with not a lot of flavor. The aftertaste was bitter, without much fruit. “I don’t know what to say because nothing stands out. It’s just wine,” Nicole said. At this price, you can find wines that are _much_ better, and we grade this wine a **D.**

An easy drinking blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese with berry fruit flavors and supple tannins. Enjoyed with grilled NY strip steaks.

Young, fruity and spicy in nature, the wine’s body (‘mouth feel’: light, medium, full-bodied), is provided by the Sangiovese, while the fruit and structure (think tannins) by the Cabernet, in a 50/50 blend. This is a wine to be drunk in its youth, suiting rich, meaty pasta sauces, as well as grilled poultry and game. This is a wonderful, great-value Italian table wine, and, earning itself another plus-point with me; comes with a handy screw-cap for easy opening and storage!
