# The 411 on Blue Crown Bistro

*Address:*\
1061 B Street\
Hayward, CA\
*Website:* <https://www.blue-crown-bistro.com/>\
*Phone:* 510-274-5585

Blue Crown Bistro is the third business I’ve seen in this downtown Hayward location. [The previous one](https://thegourmez.com/blog/2016-05-12-brews-brats-review-hayward/) served up very dry sausages—Blue Crown Bistro has improved on that dish! My husband enjoyed his sausage dog at BCB more than at the last restaurant in this space!

 They offer 4-5 draft beers and the bar is decently stocked. I’m intrigued by their growing cocktail list.

*The Vibe:* Dubbed a sports bar, Blue Crown Bistro is one long bar counter with about five small tables and a patio out front. It feels low-key and the clientele is friendly. That’s all welcoming to me!

# My Take on Blue Crown Bistro

*The Food:* The only other time I’ve been here, they had quite a large menu for a new joint, but were offering much the same fare as the rest of downtown Hayward: burgers, tacos, wings, salads, etc. They’ve streamlined the menu since then, focusing more on just a couple options in each category. Luckily, they still had the birria fries on the menu, which I think could become a signature draw for them.

Lots of good flavor in the beef, but mostly, it’s just a fun fry dish for when you’re filling more hangry than fancy.

I also enjoyed the simple hamburgers we had here on our past visit.

*The Drinks:* Not going to lie—I’d like more draft options so I can depend on finding a stout or hazy IPA there. But I am excited about the experimentation going on in the cocktail menu!

 I wasn’t sure this was the sort of place to make a nice negroni or manhattan at first, but I’ve been impressed with what I’ve sampled so far and look forward to trying more.

*Would I Go Back?* Sure would, but so far, I think of Blue Crown Bistro as a sound second choice when Buffalo Bill’s is too crowded for food or the Bistro too crowded for beer. But if more of those cocktails are as good as the ones I’ve had, that may change!
