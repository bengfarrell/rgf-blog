In case you haven't noticed, I've (or rather, my husband has) moved my food, drink, and travel blog over to my main website. This is effectively me saying "Screw niche blogging!" and keeping all forms of my writing together. It's probably silly, but I always felt bad when I posted about my fiction writing on _the Gourmez_, like I was interrupting my readers' feast to say, "Hey! There's this other thing I do too! See! Read my things on the bookshelves behind the dinner table!"

So now it's all in one place, and I think I like the change. It feels more authentic to me somehow, like all of Becca the Writer is now on display. I've also begun taking my camera out to restaurants again, so I think that means I'm nearly settled in here in the Bay Area. I'm not going to maintain the three posts a week I was doing in North Carolina--that was just insane of me in the first place, especially because I contribute columns to _All My Writers_ on a weekly basis as well. But I will aim for twice weekly posts about food and drink, mainly on Tuesdays and Thursdays. And when I have other things to share with you, it'll just pop up randomly on another day of the week like this blog today. Sound good?

My husband assures me that no RSS feeds need to be updated, but I don't know if that'll always be the case, so there's no harm in clicking that little button on the top of the page to get the feed for this site instead. And I know most my blog readers are North Carolina based at present, but I hope you'll still find my food adventures worth exploring from 3,000 miles away. For once, my Californian friends are enjoying seeing places they can go instead. I think that's a fair turnaround after six years of blogging.

And now back to fiction for the rest of today. I've got a giant bird I need to wrangle into a short story. It flew out of the last half somehow, and now I must lure it back in. As always, thanks for reading!
