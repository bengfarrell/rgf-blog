**Tempra Tantrum 2009** Bodegas, Spain

This wine with a moderately amusing name is a tempranillo and cabernet sauvignon blend. You’d think they’d go all tempranillo with the name, but trust me—they did well with the blend. They also sell a tempranillo and shiraz blend under the same name, just in case you get confused!

The nose is full of raspberry, blackberry, and some varied pepper scents.  The first taste is very pleasing. It’s full of tart berries, brown sugar, and lots of dark chocolate. There’s some tobacco dancing around the medium-bodied wine’s edges. With airing, the berry ripens and the brown sugar tastes flambéed.

With or without airing, it’s delicious.

> I find Tempranillo wines to be hit or miss for me but this one was pretty much on target. Nose is filled with spicy black pepper and blackberry. Flavors are filled with juicy red fruits and plum with a slightly dry finish. Well balanced tannins and complexity make this a very easy drinking wine.

[The Good Wine Guru](http://www.thegoodwineguru.com/tempra-tantrum-tempranillo-cabernet-2009/)

> The aromas of the wine were of berry, and based on the nose I was expecting a fairly fruit forward wine, but that’s not what I got.
> 
> Sure, there were flavors of berry, but there were also hints of chocolate and a smoothness to the wine that I found incredibly enjoyable.  Paired with a dinner of pork tenderloin and risotto, this wine was a perfect complement, and quite honestly was great just by itself.  This may actually be one of the best value wines I’ve had in a while, and I definitely recommend trying it out if you come across a bottle of it.

> Rich red color with very bright and vibrant red fruit aromas and brambly flavors. Explosive raspberry, blackberry, and cherry come through upfront with plum and black currant notes lurking underneath. Good length, soft, well-balanced with good acidity.
