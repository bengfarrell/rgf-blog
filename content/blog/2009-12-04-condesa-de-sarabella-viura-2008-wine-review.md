Wine: **Condesa de Sarabella Viura 2008** Region:  Spain

![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/gourmez/photos/condesa 004.jpg)

This pleasant wine starts with a faint nose of apples.  A mild sweetness rolls over your tongue until it fades to minerality, with a twist of lime. Sweet cream, kiwi, and fresh green grapes usher it to the back of your throat.

This wine sells for $4.99 at Trader Joe's. It taste a bit watered down, but is an easy to drink white wine. The taste is unremarkable, with hints that taste of Vigoneer and small flavors of Chardonnay . . . We have other inexpensive white wines from Trader Joe's that we liked better . . . and will probably not purchase this one again. _Review by The Gourmez 11.22.09._
