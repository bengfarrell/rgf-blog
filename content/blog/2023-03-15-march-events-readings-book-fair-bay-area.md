I'll be appearing at a few events in the Bay Area, coming up this week and next. Here's the deets:

**The Wizard's Homecoming Book Launch**

I am thrilled to celebrate my friend, the talented Elwin Cotman, and his new speculative poetry collection, _The Wizard‚Äôs Homecoming_, this coming **Friday, March 17, at 7:00pm Pacific Time**! I'm also thrilled that he asked me to read as part of the celebration.

The book launch takes place at [Hasta Muerte Coffee](https://hastamuertecoffee.com/) in Oakland, and Elwin will also be hosting comic artist Dan McCloskey for the evening. Come on out! [More Info.](https://fb.me/e/2ABUj9I3t)

**Strong Women ‚Ä¢ Strange Worlds Birthday Book Fair**

This event intimidates me, to be honest. Why? Because it‚Äôs _not_ a reading but twenty minutes of time for me to just talk about my books, my writing process, the publishing industry, and maybe even how my foodie ways influence my fiction. I‚Äôm afraid of being a rambling mess....but if you‚Äôd be entertained by a rambling Rebecca Gomez Farrell, check it out! SWSW‚Äôs birthday festivities will be going on all day, but you should be able to [tune in here](https://fb.me/e/2BcceGZU5) on Facebook at 12:00pm to find me. Sumiko Saulson and KC Grifant will also be authors on display during that Book Fair hour.

**SF in SF**

I am delighted to return to [SF in SF](http://www.sfinsf.org/) for my second reading with that great celebration of speculative fiction writers! It takes place on **Sunday, March 25, at 6:30pm** at the American Bookbinders Museum in San Francisco.

After our readings, Cliff Winning will interview me and fellow guest, Mia Tsai. We‚Äôll be taking questions from the audience as well, and [Soma FM](https://somafm.com/about/) will be recording the event for their station. Come grab a seat and ask me whatever you‚Äôd like. Even what my characters would pick as their favorite cocktails. üçπ All proceeds from the $10 entry fee and the cash bar are donated to the [American Bookbinders Museum](https://bookbindersmuseum.org/).

Will I see you in March? I hope so! But if not....more April events will be announced soon!
