**Hot Guava** [Dos Perros](http://dosperrosrestaurant.com/), Downtown Durham [Restaurant Review](../../../../../?p=1394) $8

![](http://www.thegourmez.com/gourmez/photos/dosperros02.JPG)

The Hot Guava is a margarita made from guava juice, jalapenos, tequila, and lime. The jalapeno was bright and powerful from the first sip, but I think that was the problem---all you could taste was that sweet heat and a little bit of sourness. It cancelled out the guava flavor entirely for me.

Now, I love spice, so I drank this happily, but it's definitely not the best jalapeno cocktail I've had. [The Sting](../../../../../?p=472=1) at the Hive gets that honor.
