This entry in my creative works is by no means a published piece of fiction. Rather, it is my aha moment about writing, recorded as part of Mutual Omaha's nation advertisement campaign. They asked me to record a spot, and I said yes, remembering "Sardines," the first piece of creative work that truly made me a writer...in that I spent all day reciting the poem over and over in my head while on a family vacation at the age of 9. Here is the Aha Moment video.
