I'm still a bit confused about what I drank. The ingredients were 3 Olives Cherry Vodka and Buffalo Wings and Rings's house lemonade. I think I made a mistake in assuming the lemonade would be fresh rather than a mix, so my expectations were higher than they should have been. What I ended up with tasted like liquid cherry Sour Patch kids.  It was also very sweet, which tempered the sour well, but this sort of drink is the type that makes me think about how many calories I'm drinking. That's never a good thing. It was drinkable, just not very inventive or fresh.
