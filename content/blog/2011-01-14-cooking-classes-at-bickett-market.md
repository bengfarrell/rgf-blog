It features produce, wines, and meat from local farmers and producers. Turns out, however, that produce is scarcer this time of the year, so Jason Stegall, the owner, is looking to promote their new line-up of cooking classes instead. They also have a bunch of just-plain events coming up. As I’m always happy to promote events involving good food and drink, here’s a list of what they have scheduled for the next week alone:

1/15: FRESH the movie screening and locavore meals for two! Jason and his crew of amazing sustainable chefs will be cooking up a locavore meal for you to enjoy during the film followed by an open panel discussion. Come enjoy a delicious meal made with all local, sustainable ingredients, and meet your local farmers, local real-food distributors and find out how you can support them while improving your health.  Among several main characters, FRESH features urban farmer and activist, Will Allen, the recipient of MacArthur's 2008 Genius Award; sustainable farmer and entrepreneur, Joel Salatin, made famous by Michael Pollan's book, _The Omnivore's Dilemma_; and supermarket owner, David Ball, challenging our Wal-Mart dominated economy.

1/19 at 7 pm: Making cookies from scratch. Types of dough, storage, and all the basics will be covered.

1/20 at 11 am: Brunch series on French Toast. Learn how to make excellent french toast, dip toast in eggs, and learn about champagne mimosas.

1/20 at 7 pm: Vegetarian Casseroles, learn braising techniques, use local (Raleigh harvested) wild oyster mushrooms, sweet and fingerling potato, squash, beets, butternut, and a unique twist on twice-baked acorn squash. There will be homemade pasta and cabbages in these recipes. Includes full dinner.

1/21 at 7 pm: Cooking healthy side dishes.

1/22 at 1 pm: Bickett Market's Barbecue Bash (not a class but a party): Slow-cooked, cherry-wood-smoked whole pig, all kinds of sausages from JBetskis restaurant, ice-cold craft beer samplings from Fullsteam Brewery, and much more seasonal grub.

1/22 at 6 pm: Another screening of FRESH!

1/22 at 7 pm: Brunch series on Eggs Benedict. Learn to poach eggs, make homemade hollandaise sauce with lemon and fresh chives, and experience Smithfield country ham while sipping on fresh rhubarb mimosas.

The costs for these courses and events run from $18 to $35 and usually include a meal in the deal. I plan to check out at least one in the next few weeks, but I'm not sure which yet. If you go to one, let me know! For the complete line-up and details., head to their [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/bickettmarketcookingclass/calendar/list/) calendar.
