**Horizon 2004 Carolina Comfort** Other words on the label: Sweet Blanc, White Table Wine

That's an awful lot of names for a simple white wine. This is sweet enough to use as a dessert wine. It tastes of caramelized sugar with a tinge of casaba melon. There is peach in the nose but none in the taste. It reminds me of a pastry that's so heavy on glaze, you can hardly taste the bread.

If Horizon billed Carolina Comfort as a dessert wine, I'd give it an avocado. But as a table white, it's very clean and simple but just a chicken.
