This red wine is packed full of berry, with a touch of citrus.  Blueberry and unripened blackberry are the main elements and now I wonder if that citrus was really just the tartness of the blackberry.  There is an earthiness of soil as well.

I couldn't make it through a glass.  I blame the blueberry.   By all means, try it if you like that round, cloying berry.  I do not.
