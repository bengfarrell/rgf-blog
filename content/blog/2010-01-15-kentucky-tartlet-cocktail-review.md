One of my New Year's Resolutions this year was to spend less money on alcohol. While you might think this would cut down on my wine and cocktail reviews, I refuse to let it! Reviews of cocktails from nearby bartenders will, indeed, be less frequent, but I plan to fill that void with cocktails of my own creation. Let it be known: I am no cocktail master. I miss nearly as often as I hit gold with my experimentation but that will not discourage me. You will get to see my failures as well as successes. You're overjoyed, I'm sure.

Let it also be known that I generally only have about 3-4 base liquors at a time and 6 or so mixers. Right now, those are leaning towards coffee or cream-based drinks, so what did I chose to make last night? A fruity drink!

**Kentucky Tartlet**

1.5 shots of Ancient Age Bourbon Whiskey\
0.75 shot of Dekuyper Triple Sec\
Two drops (or so) of rosewater\
4 shots Trader Joe's Pomegranate Limeade

Shake together and pour into a martini glass that ought to have been chilled, but wasn't, so add in some crushed ice for kicks.

**The Verdict:** Pretty good, actually. It lacks the tartness I was hoping for from the limeade, but those drops of rosewater give it a lot of depth. Believe me, keep it to two drops; overdosing on rosewater is not a good idea. I've ruined a good number of cocktails that way. But back to this drink, I don't taste the bourbon whiskey much, but it's stronger toward the bottom and combines well with the other ingredients. The juice is too sweet and should probably be cut back to two shots' worth, which would bring out the bourbon whiskey more, too. The triple sec and rosewater are definitely present in the right amounts.

With some fiddling, it could easily rise to an avocado.
