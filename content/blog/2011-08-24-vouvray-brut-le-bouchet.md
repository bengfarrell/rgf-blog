**Vouvray Brut Le Bouchet** Loire Valley, France

This sparkling wine (someday, I’m going to buck tradition and just start calling them all champagne, but that day is not today) is made from 100% chenin blanc grapes. It’s light in texture and full of tight bubbles. Sweetness is rampant among the kiwi, grapefruit, and almond notes.

For a delicate sparkling wine, you could do a lot worse than le Bouchet.

Other Bloggers’ Thoughts

Couldn’t find any because I’m pretty sure this isn’t a Francois Chidaine wine, who appears to be a fancypants winemaker in the Loire Valley, and his wines were the only ones showing up in my search for Vouvray Brut Le Bouchet. I did learn that le Bouchet is the name of the vineyard, though. And I had thought the French were getting creative with their wine names for a minute. Silly me.
