Stay.Com is a mobile travel guide with a beautiful interface that I'm thrilled to be featured on! That fancy new badge you see on the right side of the screen, or bottom of the screen if you're on your phone, announces me as a Stay.Com local expert.

The company recruits culinary professionals and new media folks like me to come up with virtual guides to the cities we live in, and it's all available for free through your browser or Android or iPhone device. I've only completed one guide so far, but I'm pretty sure there will be more in my future soon. You can visit my **Best Eats of Oakland** guide right here.

Folks, there are a lot of startup companies aiming to do similar things as Stay.Com -- and I've passed on participating in number of them. The reason I chose to go ahead and create a guide with Stay.Com is because I truly believe it's one of the best-designed interfaces I've seen for this sort of traveler's aide. Give it a shot for yourself! Or just wish me well as I come up with more guide ideas. Best Tasting Rooms in Jack London Square, anyone? Or Best Ice Cream on College Ave? I am up to this task!
