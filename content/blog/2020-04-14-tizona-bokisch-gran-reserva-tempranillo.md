**Tizona by Bokisch 2014 Gran Reserva Tempranillo** Bokisch Vineyards Lodi, CA

Bokisch Vineyards ([website](https://www.bokischvineyards.com/)) is one of my favorite vineyards in the Lodi region, which is one of California’s best wine-growing American Vinicultural Areas (AVAs). **_Obligatory disclaimer:_** _This wine was free to me to sample for this review._

I first became acquainted with Bokisch Vineyards at the 2016 Wine Bloggers Conference, where I named their **2015 Bokisch Vineyards Terra Alta Albarino** one of [my most memorable wines](https://thegourmez.com/2016/09/02/most-memorable-wines-from-the-2016-wine-bloggers-conference-part-1/) from the conference. Markus and Liz Bokisch have been devoted to mastering Spanish varietals in the Lodi AVA since the late 1990s.

Their _Tizona by Bokisch_ line features “limited production wines done in unique styles” per their press release.

A _gran reserva_ wine, following Spain’s requirements, spends at least two years aging in oak and five years total aging from harvest to the glass. Bokisch’s 2014 Tizona Gran Reserva Tempranillo may be made in Lodi, but they follow the Spanish guidelines, and the grapes for this wine come from twenty-year-old cuttings from Ribera del Duero. It’s an astoundingly good wine. Have I mentioned that tempranillo is my favorite wine grape recently?

In the glass, a strong brick-red coloring presents itself. Those bricks are well-fired, with plenty of brown edges.

Its nose is floral with vanilla and yeasty danish pastry notes. Let this wine seep into your skin through your taste buds. It offers a refreshing medium body with minimal tannins for a wine oaked for three years. Minimal heat, too, as it tastes as though it comes from a cooler elevation than it does. Boysenberry, licorice, and toasted curry seeds crunch on my palate. Jerky comes in partway though, with cinnamon. On the finish, cocoa and cherry put you to bed, with a nice linger. Dream of a wet, cool, eucalyptus grove as you slide into this tempranillo’s satiny sheets for a good restful sleep.

I would love to try this wine with an adventurous shortbread cookie, perhaps flavored with peppercorns or lavender. I can also picture it going well with parmesan, whether by the chunk or with a parmesan-encrusted lamb or chicken roast.

Only 300 cases of the 2014 Tizona by Bokisch Gran Reserva Tempranillo exist. It is 100% tempranillo grapes and is valued at $60 USD. You can order it at Bokisch’s [website store](https://www.bokischvineyards.com/Shop-Wines/Gran-Reserva).

A great way to be introduced to this and other Bokisch wines would be to take part in one of Bokisch’s new virtual tasting experiences! The next one is coming up this Friday, April 17, and will highlight their 2019 Garnacha Blanca with a visit to the Bokisch’s home kitchen for storytelling about the vineyard and a cooking demonstration.
