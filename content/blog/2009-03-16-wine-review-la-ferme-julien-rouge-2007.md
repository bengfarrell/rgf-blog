This wine is a blend of grenache, syrah, carignan, and cinsault. I've only heard of the first two before. There are an awful lot of grape varietals in the world, aren't there?

It smells sweet, smooth, and tingly with some earthiness.

The taste is restrained, reminding me of cumin and roasted tomato. It's pleasant and mellow.
