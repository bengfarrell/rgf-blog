Hello lovely readers,

I'm going to be migrating all of my posts done previously to using Wordpress software into the Wordpress system over the next few days (hopefully, that's all it will take). I'm going to try and figure out if I can stop the RSS from updating for each of these since there'll be at least 100, I think, but I'm less than certain I'll be successful at stopping the feed updates for them, so your stream may soon be flooding with The Gourmez posts. Apologies, if so!

To make up for this hardship, please be calmed by these new photos of the kitty gods of Woodcroft. Loki has discovered a new way to demand his tribute.

He's quite pleased with himself about it.

And now, you can see all three cats in their natural atmosphere.

Kittens on the march, err, lie down.
