**Darien Tempranillo 2008 Riojo** Logrono, Spain

![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/gourmez/photos/darienrioja.jpg)

This Spanish red rises to the roof of my mouth right away. There's some pucker for sure, too much for me. I taste orange, currant, and leafy bitter greens. I don't like drinking it; it's not full enough or balanced enough for me. No nose to speak of.

Aroma of black fruit, pepper, and toasted wood. Flavor of berries and nuts with soft tannins. I would check it out if I were you!

[Wine Cask Blog](http://winecask.blogspot.com/2006/03/darien-rioja-tempranillo-2004-wine.html) on the 2004 vintage

In the Spanish value wine category, this one is worth the money. At $9, it delivers a nice introduction to Tempranillo. The style is very new world and fruity, which will make this enjoyable for a wide variety of people. Serve it up with a hearty meat and rice dish. Raise a glass!

[Vintravel](http://blog.vintravel.com/?p=4) on the 2005 vintage

We thought the wine had good fruit flavor, but lacked body and an after taste. Part of this is the fact that it is a 12.5% wine, low for a red by today's standards. However, the benefit of a lower alcohol wine is that you can enjoy it without worrying about your consumption. We thought it was a tasty, good wine at a very good price. Overall, I think it's a good wine a good price. I'd buy more, and drink it when I was looking for a lighter red wine.

\*Per these reviews, I'd say you might have better luck with an earlier vintage than I did with this one.
