This afternoon, I walked into my favorite local coffee shop, Bean Traders at Homestead Market on Highway 54, to discover that they bought the empty storefront next door and managed to open it since the last time I was in. Gentle reader, not only did this remind me that it's been far too long since I've whiled away an afternoon here with my trusty laptop, it also fills me with glee as the new room is devoted to extra seating, a fantastic addition as it never had quite enough room for all its tables and chairs. The new room is a cheery yellow, complete with a mural in the back of a grinning carton of milk, cup and saucer, muffin, and an orange with a straw impaling it. This strikes me as a very appropriate backdrop for the play area located there. The orange laminate floor hearkens back to the wall color of the original space, tying the two rooms neatly together, at least when you're peering into both through the archway between. I'm always excited when stores I patron get the chance to expand; it's a good sign that I will be able to enjoy them for years to come. So if any of you are Bean Traders fans and haven't seen the new room yet (it opened a month ago per employee report) then head down for a cup of coffee soon!
