# Intro

*Obligatory Disclaimer:* This wine was given to me as a free sample to review for this blog. 

The 2019 Prats + Symington Post Scriptum is a pleasingly light red wine blend of grapes typically used for Port wine. It’s born out of a partnership between winemaker Bruno Prats of Bordeaux and the legendary Symington Family Estates of the Douro Valley.

# Thoughts on Tasting the 2019 Prats + Symington Post Scriptum

*Most memorable flavors?* There’s definitely a strong alcohol smell at first, but nice winemaking overcomes that quickly. Berry notes are foremost: blackberries and Queen Anne’s cordial cherries. Mint and mild licorice round out this light-bodied treat.

*What would I pair it with?* A salad of prosciutto and melon with ricotta.

*Would I drink it again?* Absolutely.

*At this $27 price?* Sounds reasonable.
