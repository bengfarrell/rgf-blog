**Cline Zinfandel 2007** Region:  California

![](http://www.rebeccagomezfarrell.com/gourmez/photos/clinezin.jpg)

The nose is bright and fruity.  Raspberry comes to mind.

Upon drinking, I get a full mouth of fruit.  It's leafy, zippy, and tastes closer to currants than raspberries.

This is quite flavorful but perhaps a bit too much so.
