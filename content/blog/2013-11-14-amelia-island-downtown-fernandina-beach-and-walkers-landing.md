It's nearly six months later, but I'm finally finishing up my photo blogs for our Amelia Island trip last May. Because I've only had one short vacation since then, it doesn't actually feel that long ago that Ben and I wandered the streets of downtown Fernandina Beach, though we live on the other coast now. I love it here, but there's something to be said for warm beach towns where cold fog is an unknown quantity.

Fernandina Beach is the city under seven flags, which means seven different countries have claimed it at one point or another. Those influences are present walking the few short blocks near their retail center along Centre Street. Just follow Highway A1A in and you can't miss it.

There are several beautiful churches on the small stretch, and a few just down the low-numbered side streets.

The colorful wildlife will keep you entertained on the walk as well.

Need a break? Have some rocky road fudge from Fantastic Fudge at the corner of Centre and 3rd Streets.

You can watch the workers making more fudge as you indulge.

There are worse ways to spend an afternoon. But what would be worse than refusing fudge would be not going the remaining three blocks to the marina on the Amelia River.

You'll pass Fernandina's old train house along the way—

\--as well as this friendly character—

Once you hit the waterfront, make sure to watch out for those manatees!

Unfortunately, I didn't see one at all. But I did get to spend some time with this handsome fellow.

Downtown Fernandina Beach was certainly idyllic, but the best part of our trip was hands down the evening spent at Walker's Landing on the marshes. It's just a short walk or bike ride from the Omni Plantation Resort, and it's amazing at sunset. I'm going to let these pictures speak for themselves.

And finally, Ben and I on the water.
