**Pecan Pie Martini** Rockfish Seafood Grill \*CLOSED\* The Streets at Southpoint Durham, NC

It's rare that I have to choke down a drink. Of course, it didn't help that the bartender looked about 17 and told me that I was only the second person to ever order it, but I think that this martini was the brainchild of a corporate executive paid only to think up seasonal menu changes. I drank it mainly to avoid hurting the bartender's feelings.

The drink looked appealing. It's creamy brown with pie crust crumbs dotting a healthy portion of whipped cream and lining the rim. However, the liquers involved mixed worse than the Pope and Turkey. I couldn't help but gag at the first sip. I think it was mostly well vodka. There was also a touch of Irish cream and possibly amaretto moonlighting as pecan flavoring. Did I mention the well vodka?

Oh well, maybe I'll stick to the pie version in the future.
