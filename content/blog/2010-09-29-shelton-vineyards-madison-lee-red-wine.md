**Shelton Vineyards Madison Lee Red Wine** Dobson, NC

I like Shelton Vineyard's pinwheel logo---it has a bit of renaissance flair to it. This is the first time the filter on my wine aerator has come in handy; there's a lot of silt in the bottle. It smells of Dove dark chocolate (you know, that somehow still creamy dark chocolate), vanilla, and strawberries.

It tastes much better than I expected, and feels smooth and velvety. Rhubarb and dried strawberries with nutmeg come to mind. Chocolate lingers in the aftertaste. It's a tad sweet, but not enough to declare it a wannabe dessert wine. Light tannins, simple to drink. I think it would be very refreshing as a summer wine. Alas, the summer has finally passed (fingers crossed).

This easy drinking red table wine named for the Shelton brothers' two grandfathers, is a Bordeaux style blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc.  We often suggest this wine to our friends who aren't sure if they like red wine.  It is medium-bodied, rich deep red in color.  It has aromas of ripe red fruits and flavors of berries, vanilla and a hint of spice.

Madison Lee Red is medium-bodied and very approachable. As promised the berry fruit comes through, as well as a hint of vanilla.
