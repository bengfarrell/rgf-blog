**Azure Grill \*CLOSED\***\
407 Meadowmont Village Circle\
Chapel Hill, NC

Let it be known, this is the one and only time I have ever liked sweet tea. I don't particular like to drink liquefied sugar, but it's easy to take when cut with muddled raspberries and bourbon. The bourbon was very well measured—just enough to encourage sipping instead of guzzling or nose wrinkling. It was tasty and smooth.
