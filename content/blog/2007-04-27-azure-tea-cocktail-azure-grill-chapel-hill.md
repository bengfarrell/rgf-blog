**Azure Tea Cocktail** Azure Grill \*CLOSED\* 407 Meadowmont Village Circle Chapel Hill, NC

Let it be known, this is the one and only time I have ever liked sweet tea. I don't particular like to drink liquefied sugar, but it's easy to take when cut with muddled raspberries and bourbon. The bourbon was very well measured---just enough to encourage sipping instead of guzzling or nose wrinkling. It was tasty and smooth.
