I would love to have you join me in Alameda for this author event. As I'm the only author on the agenda, I am a bit nervous about having a turnout...this is why I usually invite more authors to read with me. ;)Â  RSVP through Eventbrite [right here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rebecca-gomez-farrell-at-alameda-authors-series-3-tickets-54511530455), and yes, it's free. I will have copies of _Wings Unsee_n available for sale.

Host Kevis Brownson and I will have a conversation about my writing and the organizations I'm involved with, then I'll do a reading, then there will be audience Q&A, and then a signing and reception to wrap up the evening. 6 pm is early! So don't worry about sliding in a bit late.

Here's the series description: For the third year, the [**AAUW Alameda**](https://alameda-ca.aauw.net/what-is-aauw/) presents a spring series of talks featuring authors who live and write in Alameda and nearby, now co-sponsored by [t**he Friends of the Alameda Free Library**](https://alamedafriends.com/). Our February author Rebecca Gomez Farrell will discuss her novel _Wings Unseen_ and her current writing projects.

Hope to see you there!
