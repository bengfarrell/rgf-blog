The WWS Submission Conference is a one day, online event on **Saturday, August 8**, 2020, beginning at **10 am PT.** I'll be appearing on the panel entitled **"Empowering your Community: A Talk with WWS Chapter Leads"** at **2:15 pm**.

This is a topic near and dear to me, as I'm a strong supporter in the importance of writer communities for keeping up motivation and perseverance in a writer's career. To that end, I have been a chapter lead with Women Who Submit (WWS) for the past few years, running one of their Bay Area chapters.

[What's WWS?](http://womenwhosubmitlit.org/aboutwws2/) Well, they are the hosts of this conference and a national organization devoted to empowering women and nonbinary writers by creating physical and virtual spaces for sharing information, supporting and encouraging submissions to literary journals, and clarifying the submission and publication process.

If you fit those criteria: a writer who identifies as a woman and/or nonbinary, you are welcome to attend this free conference! Tickets will be limited to 100 participants, and registration closes on Thursday. You can register by completing [this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4-UwHkCKVv7zRueGZiYa--juT9Q0BXtGW_EJ74dvN7wYNxA/viewform). Here's the schedule for the conference!

- 10am-11am: New Member Orientation with WWS Director, Xochitl-Julisa Bermejo
- 11:15am-12:15pm: Demystifying Top Tier Submissions with Cynthia Guardado, Anita Gill, Hazel Kight Witham, moderated by Lituo Huang
- 12:15pm-1pm: Zoom Lunch
- 1pm-2pm: Magazine and Journal Editors Share Best Practices with Cassandra Lane, Raina Le√≥n, Muriel Leung, moderated by Ramona Pilar
- 2:15-3:15: Empowering your Community: A Talk with WWS Chapter Leads Desiree Kannel, Rebecca Gomez Farrell, and moderated by Ashaki M. Jackson

I am so excited for this conference! I love watching WWS expand its outreach, as it has done over the last several years. The more of us getting our worked published, the better! And supporting each other through the often disheartening submission process is one way to do that.
