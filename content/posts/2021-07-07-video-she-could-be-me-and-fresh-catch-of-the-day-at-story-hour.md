In March, I was delighted to appear on [Story Hour](https://www.storyhour2020.com/), a weekly speculative fiction reading. Audiences can join the Zoom recording directly or they can watch live or in replays [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/The-Story-Hour-102109784794285/). This is the second time I've read for Story Hour, and I have to say, it's great fun that a reading exists that so appreciates the short story form. I read two short stories, ["She Could Be Me"](/creative-works/she-could-be-me/) and ["Fresh Catch of the Day,"](/creative-works/fresh-catch-day/) during my half of the episode. At the time, they were upcoming publications (or re-publication, in the case of "She Could Be Me"), but as life has continued the untimely delay of my posting updates here, both have since come out!

I'll have posts very soon announcing where you can find the stories. In the meantime, enjoy my Story Hour reading! It takes place in the first half of the episode, and I was delighted to read with Edward Austin Hall, who reads in the second half of the hour. Do note that Edward's excerpts are on the graphic side of horror, should that be a concern for you. Mine are both fairly lightweight this time around, one Twilight Zonesque horror short and one low-fi fantasy tale.

Thanks so much to Daniel Marcus and Laura Blackwell, who host Story Hour, for the invite back!
