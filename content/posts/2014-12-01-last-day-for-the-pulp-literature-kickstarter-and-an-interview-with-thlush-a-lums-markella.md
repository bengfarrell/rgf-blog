The countdown clock is ticking! There are only 22 hours left in _PULP Literature'_s Year 2 Kickstarter campaign, and the magazine's at 89% of its goal. That's so close! Please consider boosting it up over the edge. By doing so, you'll be supporting fiction writers as _PULP Literature_ pays professional rates. Which means you'll be supporting me as my "Thlush-A-Lum" will be published in the next few weeks in _PULP Literature_ Issue #5. Just click that little image below, and you can reserve your $5 e-copy or $15 print copy of Issue #5 now. Do it. Do it!

Additionally, "Thlush-A-Lum's" main character, Markella, gave _PULP Literature_ an interview last week. What did this young woman have to say about her family, the noises that seek her out, and what she thinks of herself?

Missed my teaser earlier? Here's "Thlush-A-Lum"s first few lines:

> Markella’s earliest memories are of the sounds outside her window. At hours when no men moved, rustling branches and shuffling grass woke her. A beating pulse like slower, fleshier helicopter blades banished sleep: thlush-a-lum thlush-a-lum. In summers, the heat in her attic bedroom hot enough to incubate, Markella pushed the window open and dozed to the endless static drone of cicadas. In winters, choking radiator warmth wrapped tight around her, she cracked the window and the low, deep hoots of an owl drifted in with the freezing breeze.
>
> The sounds crept in no matter the season.

And look out for _PULP Literature_ Issue #5 coming your way soon!
