In February, I let you all know about the opportunity to get your hands on one of my short stories for free for a limited time. And now that time is almost at an end! "Bother," along with many other fantastic stories collected by M. David Blake for the _2013 Campbellian Pre-Reading Anthology,_ will only be available until 4/30. So what are you waiting for? Click your browsers on over to _Stupefying Stories_ and [get your copy](http://stupefyingstories.blogspot.com/2013/02/just-released-2013-campbellian-pre.html "Anthology links")! And be sure to give Durham author Mur Lafferty your congratulations on being nominated for the Campbell Award for the second straight year. Some of her work is also available in the anthology. You can find her at the [Murverse](http://murverse.com/ "The Murverse").

Here's what I posted to explain the anthology in February:

Published by [_Stupefying Stories_](http://stupefyingstories.blogspot.com/ "Stupefying Stories"), the _2013 Campbellian Pre-Reading Anthology_ is now available for free—that's right, free!—for anyone interested in perusing the works of authors eligible for Campbell award nominations this year. What's that? As M. David Blake, editor of _Stupefying Stories_ explained,

> Named for **John W. Campbell, Jr.**, whose 34 years at the helm of _Astounding Science Fiction_ (later renamed _Analog_) defined the "Golden Age" of the genre and launched the careers of dozens of famous writers, the [**John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Campbell_Award_for_Best_New_Writer) is presented annually at WorldCon to an outstanding author whose first professional work of science fiction or fantasy was published within the previous two years.

What does this have to do with me? Well, with my sale of "Bother" to _Bull Spec_ nearing on two years ago now, I became eligible for the Campbell Award. I have absolutely no expectations of being nominated, especially because I haven't had other speculative fiction published since then—I've been working on my first fantasy novel instead of sending out my short stories. But "Bother" has been reprinted in the anthology, and now's your chance to read it for free along with other worthy works by a large list of fantastic speculative fiction authors. All for free until the Hugo nominees, including for the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer, are announced at the end of April.

To take advantage of this amazing access to these stories, [just click here](http://stupefyingstories.blogspot.com/2013/02/just-released-2013-campbellian-pre.html "2013 Campbellian Pre-Reading Anthology") and chose the e-format you prefer at the end of the publication announcement post. And if you do read "Bother," please let me know what you thought! Us writers do thrive on feedback.
