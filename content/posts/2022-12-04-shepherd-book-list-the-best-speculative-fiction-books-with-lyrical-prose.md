Over at _Shepherd_, which is a newish website to help shepherd readers toward their next favorite books, I compiled a list of books that impress me with their sometimes poetic, sometimes beautifully figurative, prose: [The Best Speculative Fiction Books with Lyrical Prose](https://shepherd.com/best-books/speculative-fiction-with-lyrical-prose).

My choices:

This list is heavily informed by my love of African American literature (this was my Modern Literature focus in college) and my willingness to follow gorgeous imagery anywhere, anytime. Feel free to ask me more about any of my choices; I'm happy to gush.

I also mention in the article that I'm preceded by THREE GENERATIONS(!) of poets on my mother's side. Thanks to my mom, my grandfather William Parker, and my great-grandfather William Lee Popham for that legacy!

Wishing you some great new lyrical prose favorites! If you like my work, you may also want to check out the Shepherd list of [Ominously Atmospheric Stories for Winter's Night](https://shepherd.com/best-books/ominously-atmospheric-stories-for-a-winters-night) for suggestons, as _Wings Unfurled_ does have a good share of its own haunting. Also take a gander at their new [Magicians (Fantasy) shelf](https://shepherd.com/bookshelf/magic-supernatural) on their bookshelves.
