I can now share updated information on what to expect if you join me for the Alameda Authors' Day for the [American Association of University Women (AAUW)](https://alameda-ca.aauw.net/) on **March 8, 2025**!

The AAUW prioritizes increasing equity, education, health, fair pay, and careers for women and girls through nonpartisan lobbying for legislation, breaking down research barriers that women and girls face and collaborating with other organizations.

 I am happy to share that I will be speaking with this great group of motivated advocates about the work that [Woman Who Submit Lit](https://womenwhosubmitlit.org/) does to encourage women and nonbinary writers to submit their work out for publication. I organized one of the Bay Area chapters of Women Who Submit Lit for several years, and it holds a special place in my writer-community-loving heart. Expect to learn about its origins and how you can take part in one of our motivating submission parties!

Of course, I will also be reading from _Wings Unfurled,_ Book #2 in my Wings Rising duology.

There will be time for book purchases and autographs after the membership luncheon as well. The meeting begins at **1:30pm** with a social reception, then the author talks  around 2:00pm after a welcome from the current AAUW-Alameda president. Following that, we'll do a Q&A session with the audience. Who is *we*? Well, I'll be joined by mystery writer **Janet Dawson**! Here's her bio:

<blockquote> <strong>Janet Dawson</strong>’s life of crime began with her long-running series featuring Oakland PI Jeri Howard and the award-winning first novel, <em>Kindred Crimes</em>. Jeri has sleuthed her way through 14 books, including the latest, <em>The Things We Keep</em>. Along the writing way, Janet branched out to books featuring crime-solving characters Jill McLeod, working on the California Zephyr trains, and Kay Dexter, a geriatric care manager. Janet has also written a standalone suspense novel, <em>What You Wish For</em>, a novella, "But Not Forgotten," and twelve short stories, including Macavity winner "Voice Mail."
