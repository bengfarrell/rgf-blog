I am excited to announce that I’ll be participating in a literary reading in one week with [At the Inkwell](http://attheinkwell.com/about-and-news/)! Giving readings is one of my favorite parts of being a writer, though I also get just a little bit of stage fright before it’s my turn at the mike, so familiar faces in the crowd are always helpful. I am one of five authors reading on **2/29** at **Alley Cat Books** (3036 24th Street, San Francisco) from **7:00 pm** to **9:00 pm**.

I’ll be sharing “No Crossing,” the prologue to what will eventually become my third book. The theme of the reading, appropriately, is Leap Year. I considered writing a personal essay for it, seeing where inspiration led. But then I remembered "No Crossing" patiently waiting in my virtual manuscript shelf for me to write the rest of the book. It'll have to keep waiting for that narrative, but the prologue ties in wonderfully to the Leap Year theme, with a giant canyon to surmount and the shattered and re-building faith of a young girl learning that adults don't always tell the full story. Regina takes a leap at the end into what will someday be her own story ... when I write that part. ;)

Full information on the reading, along with my bio and those of the other authors, [can be found here](http://attheinkwell.com/readings/leap-year-san-francisco/).  Let me know if you plan to come!
