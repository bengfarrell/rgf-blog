The awesome and amazing [Meg Elison](http://megelison.com/), author of _the Road to Nowhere_ post-apocalyptic series, is founding and hosting this reading series that will celebrate speculative fiction in the East Bay. You can get tickets [here at Eventbrite](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eventbrite.com%2Fe%2Fparallel-lit-maiden-voyage-tickets-58534662752%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2dhCmFZXjnffXFpxp_j73PjwootL7bVdhSGcmVPsj-7X7KrfarrZ9eRRw&h=AT1_v-UfiJw9DMVkLvQ3lGwh1ia_hRzkLDOm2q3O84UZoU5QxZW1_6e3ocBmeZDsF6wEb4kok4YNtGDCCaRlkQ9StZByaBj2hjVtJC3TfVB9h4F-H7rlUZZVeiCXXbM-xw), but you can also pay at the door--$10 is not a bad price at all to hear this crew read our fiction and talk about our work! Plus, [Paulista Kitchen](http://paulista510.com/#menu) is a fantastic cafe and restaurant featuring Brazilian cuisine with California influences and the delicious cashew milk ice cream of Mr. Dewie's.

No, I am not above bribing you with food photos. It's my superpower. Meg and I will be joined by (and eating ice cream with) three other badass local spec fic authors: Tim Pratt, Juliette Wade, and Caroline Ratajski. Come join us in welcoming the birth of Parallel Lit!
