#### "Mixed Signals," or, "Learning How to Speak" Published!

You can head to their webpage to download the PDF for FREE—ABSOLUTELY FREE—and it's chockful of what's sure to be an amazing mix of literary and genre fiction, poetry, and photography. Just click on the cover image below (_yeah, sorry about that, but clicking is now disabled as their webzine has moved elsewhere_).

The print version of the magazine is not free, but at only $8 for 150 pages of brand-new fiction and poetry, it's a pretty good deal. [Order it directly from CreateSpace here](https://www.createspace.com/6498870) or [from Amazon here.](https://www.amazon.com/Typehouse-Literary-Magazine-Issue-September/dp/1537083910) I'll be picking up a couple copies myself!

#### Mini-Synopsis

"Mixed Signals" is a humorous sci-fi tale about someone down on their luck, romantically and economically. He soon discovers he has a whole lot more he should be concerned about when a crosswalk signal sends him on a convoluted scavenger hunt through the city. Yes, a crosswalk signal.

I borrowed that photo from Miami University—surprisingly, even though I'm writing stories about them, I do not have a photo of a crosswalk signal on hand! The short story hinges on a speech from which I took inspiration from that television masterpiece, _Mork and Mindy._ I, indeed, was revising that particular scene around the time of Robin Williams' death, and that encouraged me to go all in, embracing the potentially cheesy, but ideally moving, moment. Here's the first paragraph:

> _Ka-kink. Ka-kink. Ka-kink._
>
> Some guy’s hand flew to the crosswalk button as though a magnetic force drew him, a few feet from where I sat at a sidewalk café table. Dressed like a hippie and smelling like it too, he spit out the words, “Callin’ in, Cap’n. Callin’ in.” The syncopated rapidity interfered with the vibe of melancholic freedom I’d been cultivating. That morning, Alvarado Construction had pink-slipped me. Three weeks earlier, my girlfriend, Jolanda, had broken up with me, screamed me out of her place with complaints I didn’t understand her love language, and no, she didn’t mean Spanish.
>
> But I was over it. Completely.

Go read! And please share with me your thoughts on the story. Or better yet, review _Typehouse Literary Magazine_ Issue #9 on Goodreads or Amazon!

#### And the Next One is...

"Mixed Signals," while I hope it entertains all you lovely readers, is not all I have coming up the pipeline for you. Stay tuned for more announcements throughout September! In the meantime, have another picture of an important piece of the "Mixed Signals" narrative.
