**Due to rain and potential flooding, this event has been cancelled. Hopefully, I will be able to read at Moshin in March or April instead! I'll keep you updated.**

My next reading will be in the midst of wine country! On February 20, from 5:30 pm to 7 pm, [Moshin Vineyards](https://www.moshinvineyards.com/) will host a writer's salon to welcome their next Writing Between the Vines author.

What is Writing Between the Vines? It's a writing retreat that pairs writers with vineyards willing to host them with "a space to work, a place to create—surrounded by the beauty and majesty of vineyards in locations around the world," per the website. Interested authors apply in the fall and the winning applicants spend 4 to 6 days at the wineries.....writing. Just writing. How lovely that sounds!

Why am I invited to read? Beyond the wine connection [from my food blog](http://thegourmez.com), of course, I came in as a runner-up for the retreat at [Moshin Vineyards](https://www.moshinvineyards.com/).

Thus, I was asked to come in for the salon that kicks off the retreat. I am excited to share an important scene from my upcoming book, _Wings Unseen_, that features a treasured family wine.

Time allowing, I will also read "Thlush-A-Lum," my horror story published in _PULP Literature_, which also draws on wine imagery.

But I am nearly as excited to try Moshin's wines for the first time. The thrill of discovery is always galvanizing! The reading will take place at Moshin Vineyard's tasting room in Healdsburg.
