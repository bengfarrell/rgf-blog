I am happy to announce that _PULP Literature Issue #5_ has officially launched, which means my horror short story, "Thlush-A-Lum", is now available for purchase as part of the issue!

You can buy Issue #5 straight from the _PULP Literature_ website
[here.](http://pulpliterature.com/upcoming-issues/issue-5-winter-2015/)

Just click on the image to be taken to the ordering page. A print issue is $15 and an e-issue is $5. Lest that seem like a lot to you, I can confirm that I was impressed by how thick the magazine was when I received my author copy in the mail. I'm looking forward to reading all of these stories from my issue mates as described on the order page:

- > We dare you to be held captive by **Eileen Kernaghan**’s ‘The Robber Maiden’s Story’, and then try to escape alongside the intrepid Stella Ryman as she attempts a jailbreak in The Four Digit Puzzle by **Mel Anastasiou**.

- > Next, travel by boat and by bus to places you’d rather not go, with the fantastical ‘Polycarp on the Sea’ by Stephen Case and the gritty detective Finley in ‘The Pledge’ by Donald Dewey.

- > Three pulp poems by Mark J Mitchell will prepare you for the cruel transformations of ‘Thlush-a-lum’ by Rebecca Gomez Farrell and ‘Some Say the World Will End in Fire’ by R Daniel Lester.

- > These are followed by a few stories of wishing for more, in ‘A Discussion of Keats’s Negative Capability’ by Susan Pieters and Margaret Kingsbury’s ‘The Longing is Green when Branches are Trees’.

- > A treat lies in store as we publish the winners of the first annual Hummingbird Prize for Flash Fiction, followed by the short, sharp horror cartoon ‘Bait’ by Kris Sayer.

- > For dessert, we hope you’ve saved room for the next installment of _Allaigna’s Song_. It’s the perfect way to round out a good family feast.

- > All this beneath a beautiful new cover entitled “Fondly Remembered Magic” by our first cover artist **Melissa Mary Duncan.**


For those of you who contributed to _PULP Literature's_ Kickstarter campaign last month, thank you so much! I believe you should have received your Issue #5 already.

And for those of you who didn't, here's a little teaser of "Thlush-A-Lum's" first few paragraphs:

> Markella’s earliest memories are of the sounds outside her window. At hours when no men moved, rustling branches and shuffling grass woke her. A beating pulse like slower, fleshier helicopter blades banished sleep: thlush-a-lum thlush-a-lum. In summers, the heat in her attic bedroom hot enough to incubate, Markella pushed the window open and dozed to the endless static drone of cicadas. In winters, choking radiator warmth wrapped tight around her, she cracked the window and the low, deep hoots of an owl drifted in with the freezing breeze.
>
> The sounds crept in no matter the season.

I hope you enjoy "Thlush-A-Lum"...and you remember to keep an eye on those bedroom windows.
