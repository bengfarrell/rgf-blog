[The Novel Fox is](http://www.thenovelfox.com/#chapter1) a small press, founded in 2014, that specializes in bridging the divide between talented authors and the new world of digital publishing. They have three branches, and _[Anthology I](http://www.thenovelfox.com/anthology-i/)_ is the first collection released under their Shorts imprint.

The description in the press release sounded interesting to me, so I agreed to review the book (**Obligatory disclaimer:** It was provided for free). The release reads, “With stories ranging from ‘Paying Old Debts,’ about a thoughtful sex robot assassin, to ‘A Wand's Tale,’ chronicling the short life of a sentient magic wand, to ‘Subsidence,’ which includes a horrific golf hazard, the stories of _Anthology I_ are riveting from beginning to end.” Those concepts sounded entertaining enough for this speculative short fiction author! I’m an easy sell.

Although the Novel Fox has a digital focus, I was pleased to receive a print copy of the book. And I was even more pleased by its high production values!

The cover artwork is smart graphic design. The size is squarer than a standard paperback, which felt easier to handle. The nicely spaced, easily readable font also pleased me, and I loved the simple artwork at the beginning of each story—it set the mood quite well. I did worry the cover’s thick, black ink would rub off on my fingers as it felt oversaturated, but I have no smudges to report on.

Aesthetics are important in publishing, but content even more so. The anthology contains eight short stories, equally divided between science fiction and the fantastic. Interestingly, the short stories mentioned in the press release aren’t the ones I enjoyed most, though they all have redeeming qualities. Of them, “Subsidence” by Peter White is the most intriguing, employing the Lilliputian concept in a more horrific manner than I’ve seen in a while. Neil Marshall is a typical, middle-aged, wealthy male whose friend goes missing on a golf course. Moral of the story? Don’t chase after that delicious barbecue smell!

My favorite selection was the most terrifying because it doesn’t feel so far off from today. “The Shadowless,” by Rati Mehrotra, does a great job synthesizing concerns about religion, patriarchy, and the omnipresence of technology without coming across as dismissive of any of those elements. In a future Marrakech, Nissa is constantly under surveillance by the public, her family, and the government. Even her lifelong companion, a robotic bird named Juju, tracks her movements and conversations. Nissa seeks a different life, and the depths of how little control she has in this too-familiar society is exposed. Excellent pacing, characterization, and world-building.

The collection’s lead piece, “Washout” by Dominic Dulley, did an impressive job capturing the heightened emotional state of adolescence through an unconventional break-up: one between a spaceship’s user interface and Nix, a teenage girl who’s been trained to control the ship through a complete integration of mind and body. Something goes wrong, and Nix’s anguish at the separation reminded me of every teenage boyfriend I once fought bitterly to get back to, certain they had been “the one.”

The collection’s remaining five stories are entertaining but didn’t particularly resonant with me. Ernesto Pavan’s “A Wand’s Tale,” uses beautiful emotional imagery but ultimately came across as derivative—maybe I’ve watched the _Harry Potter_ films too recently. Noir fans may love Gerri Deen’s “Paying Old Debts,” but discounting _Veronica Mars,_ I’ve never been a fan of the genre, in human or android form. I’m sure other readers will find them all more satisfying.

Regardless, I think _Anthology I_ is a collection worth the read and a couple of bucks! [Click here to order it from Amazon.](http://www.amazon.com/Anthology-Collection-Science-Fiction-Fantasy-ebook/dp/B00URQYF9E)
