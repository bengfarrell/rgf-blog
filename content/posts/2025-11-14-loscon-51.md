Thanksgiving weekend, I’ll be taking part in [Loscon 51,](https://loscon.org/) in Los Angeles, CA! Guests of honor include fellow former North Carolinian Ursula Vernon, aka T. Kingfisher; artist Benton Jew; musician Lynn Gold; and fan Tadao Tomomatsu.

I have never attended a Loscon before, so I’m excited to see what science fiction and fantasy fandom looks like in SoCal, where all of my Gomez family is located. Of course, this means I have an excuse to spend a week in Los Angeles to see friends and family as well! But I am not sure how much time I’ll have to make new friends at Loscon, as they have me working hard with this schedule:

__11:30 AM, November 28__\
Autograph Session, Dealer's Room

__4:00 PM, November 28__\
Panel: Building Reader Empathy for Your Characters, Newport C

__10:00 AM, November 29__\
Panel Moderator: Writing Book 2, Newport A

__11:30 AM, November 29__\
Workshop: Destroy all Cling-Ons, Century A

__1:00 PM, November 29__\
Panel: Different Paths into Writing Careers, Newport A

__10:00 AM, November 30__\
Panel: Publishing Short Stories, Catalina D

__1:00 PM, November 30__\
Panel: Climate Change Storytelling, La Jolla

__2:30 PM, November 30__\
Spirituality In SFF, Catalina B

Friday will be my lightest day of the weekend, as both Saturday and Sunday have me on three sessions a day! I CAN DO IT! In fact, I’m psyched to do it, especially to share my “Destroy All Cling-ons” workshop again, which I haven’t run in several years. If you’re planning to attend that, you’ll learn all about my method for giving manuscripts a final polish before submission.

How do you attend? [Purchase a registration](https://loscon.org/registration-loscon51/) at loscon.org by 11/20 for the \$75 price. If you decide to attend after that, registrations are available for \$85 at the door. Are my panels and events not enough to entice you? 😉The full lineup can be viewed [here](https://loscon.lineupr.com/loscon-51/lineup).
