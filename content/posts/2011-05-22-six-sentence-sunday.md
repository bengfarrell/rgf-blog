I'm participating in something new today! It's called Six Sentence Sunday, which is organized by the fine folks over at the [Six Sentence Sunday blog](http://sixsunday.blogspot.com/). As you may be able to guess, Six Sentence Sunday is a challenge to authors to put out six sentences from any of their works, published or not, that should excite readers to read more. These six sentences are from my romance novella, _Maya's Vacation_, which is published by Astraea Press and available [at their website](http://www.astraeapress.com/#ecwid:category=662249&mode=product&product=3028832 "Astraea Press") (and Amazon, Barnes and Nobles, and Smashwords) in all e-book formats. Here we go:

> “Dean Mitchell. Nice to meet you too, Cliff.” He spoke fast and with a nervous catch in his voice, but each syllable cracked her concentration until it shattered like a boulder hitting a car windshield. She went to look, and her heart nearly stopped. It was him.
>
> It _was_ him.

Here's the cover art for Maya's Vacation.
