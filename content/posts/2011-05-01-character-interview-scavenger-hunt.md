This special Sunday blog is coming to you courtesy of the Character Interview Scavenger Hunt! What's that, you ask? Why it's a great excuse to discover the websites of a bunch of intriguing authors from Astraea Press, Whimsical Publications, and Purple Sword. Basically, you need to find the character interview on each site and answer a question based on each interview at some point during the month of May. There will be three winners pulled at random from the pool of participants who submit the correct answers to each question. Each winner will receive a different prize basket of goodies from us authors -- what's a scavenger hunt without prizes? All you need to do is have fun browsing some new blogs! There are 18 blogs to visit, but you have all month to do it -- just make sure you have your answers in before the end of the month. To participate, e-mail Robyn at promorobyn@gmail.com to let her know you want in. She'll send you the list of questions to answer and the links to the blogs.

And now, here's my interview of Maya Holden, the main character in my novelette, _Maya's Vacation_.

_Me: Maya, you seem like such a down-to-Earth woman, but tell me, how did you end up with a litter of ferrets?_

Maya: Oh, that. \[She waves it away with a giggle\]. My husband — ex-husband, now, of course, but he was my husband  then — he never let me live that one down. What happened was that Meredith Viera one day on the Today Show had these long, furry animals I’d never seen before. They were so cute, I just had to get one. So I headed to the pet store that very afternoon, and what did I find but a mother ferret with a new litter of four babies! They were all so cute, no longer than my index finger, and I just couldn’t separate them. It felt like the right thing to do, taking them all home! Chuck turned bright red when he saw them, but he never did complain, not really. He’d been married to me too long! You might say I’m a creature of instinct.

Me: _That’s hilarious, and don’t tell my husband, but I wouldn’t be surprised if I did something like that one day! Animals are hard to resist. Speaking of things that are hard to resist, what did you say about your first boyfriend recently? Something about how kissing him was like a great glass of tempranillo?_

Maya: Honey, if I were kissing Dean again, I’d drain the bottle. He was — he was something else. It was so long ago when we were together, and I was probably just giddy with first love, you know how that goes, but I can still remember how he made me feel every time we — well, you know. \[She blushes\]. But you can’t keep that sort of relationship forever.  We’ve all got to grow up sometime.

Me: _Do you really think so? Don’t some people manage to capture the magic forever?_

Maya: I suppose I believe that. But don’t you think that sort of connection is scary? I mean, I loved Dean, I loved him so much that I moved from home at 18 to live with him in a rundown flat by the beach that I thought was heaven. We were going to be painters together, but he left and then . . . I couldn’t wait forever, could I? \[She wipes a tear from her eye and breathes deeply, straightening up\]. But how did we get to this topic? Let’s talk about something more fun.

Me: _I can certainly do that! What’s your favorite dish, Maya? What food would you want on a deserted island?_

Maya: I’ll take that bottle of tempranillo, for starters! But to help wash it down, I’d go for comfort food like chicken and dumplings—it might get a little lonely out on that island. I can’t help but dress up a recipe, though, so I’d stir some gruyere into the dumpling batter and probably roast the chicken first with tarragon and oregano.

Me: _That sounds delightful! Thank you for your time, Maya._

Maya: A pleasure!
