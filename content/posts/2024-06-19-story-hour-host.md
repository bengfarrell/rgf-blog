 Last June, I was delighted to host _Story Hour,_ a weekly reading of speculative fiction regularly hosted by authors Daniel Marcus and Laura Blackwell. I've appeared as a guest on Story Hour a few times in the past, and I'm glad I could give Laura and Daniel a bit of a break this time--a weekly reading is a huge undertaking!

_Story Hour_ focuses on the short form, preferring that stories shared can be read in full during each author's half of the show. The readers for this session were Cynthia Gómez and Nadine Aurora Tabing. Let me tell you, the works they shared blew me away! Both were incredibly impactful while using beautiful language.
