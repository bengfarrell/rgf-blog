I'm going to be busy this Friday promoting my fiction, through two different mediums! You, of course, are invited to join in.

I'll be reading for the **At the Inkwell** Flash Fiction Night, which takes place at **Alley Cat Books**Â in San Francisco at **7 pm**.

This is the second time I'll have read with [At the Inkwell,](http://attheinkwell.com/) which is a national organization dedicated to helping writers get more exposure through reviews and reading series. The Alley Cat Books space is one of the best I've been to for literary readings, and I'm excited for flash fiction to be the chosen topic - it'll give me a break from reading book excerpts! I'll likely be sharing ["What Scattered in the Wind,"](https://rebeccagomezfarrell.com/fiction/what-scattered-in-the-wind), which is published in _Little Letters on the Skin_, and some Halloween-themed micro-fiction I've been working on. If there's time, perhaps "Hobgoblin" will also make an appearance at the mic. More info on the event is here: [LINKY LINK.](https://www.facebook.com/events/146538699277520/)

I would love to see you at Alley Cat Books or know you've tuned in to the Speculative Fiction Cantina this Friday!
