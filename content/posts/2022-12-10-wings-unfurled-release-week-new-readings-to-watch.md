Week 1 of the _Wings Unfurled_ Blog Tour is almost over!

![Promo graphic featuring the book covers of Wings Unseen and Wings Unfurled](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/06042806/wu-blogtour-horizontal-banner.jpg)

There are no new stops on the tour scheduled over the weekend, but I still have new content for you! But first, don't forget to swing by the Meerkat Press [masterpost](https://meerkatpress.com/wings-unfurled-blog-tour-giveaway/) to enter our $50 giftcard prize drawing! Not quite 100 folks have signed up yet, so you have a nearly 1/100 chance at the moment—that's actually really great for an online prize drawing.

New content? Yes! You can now watch video of me reading the prologue to _Wings Unfurled_! This was recorded as part of the [Strong Women, Strange Worlds](https://strongwomenstrangeworlds.weebly.com/) reading series, which I appeared in this past November. [Head here to YouTube to watch](https://youtu.be/oTnwgwFRCZ0)!

On the same YouTube page, you can watch [the full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEnyzLf9VWQ) of that First Friday Quick Reads session with Strong Women, Strange Worlds. Six authors in total read, each of us for just 8 minutes, to give you a quick sip of our work. Featured authors beside myself: Sandra Barrett, Ellen Booraem, Jennie Goloboy, Angela Yuriko, and Sylvia Woodham.

I also appeared on Story Hour this past Wednesday, which is a lovely readings series that began with the pandemic and has been running strong weekly ever since. Story Hour focuses on short stories, so I did not read from _Wings Unfurled_. Instead, I shared "[Garbage](/creative-works/garbage/)," a humorous, but as host Laura Blackwell described it, "funny and disturbing," science fiction story. I read with Barbara A. Barnett, who graces the first half hour with a short, sad read and then a longer, funny tale that'll make you think twice before your next bite of salad.

My half starts about 25:00 minutes into the Story Hour. I hope you enjoy the listen!

And let me leave you with another contextless sentence from _Wings Unfurled_. Place your order by clicking on the vendor of your choice in that right sidebar over there ↗↗↗
