Today's Blog Tour review of _Wings Unfurled_ is glowing! Thanks to Monty's Book Reviews for sharing their thoughts. Here's a snippet:

> "An enthralling story told from three separate viewpoints which are skillfully woven into a free flowing narrative that keeps the reader's interest throughout. The characters are both interesting and flawed which endears them to you as the story progresses and ensures that a vested interest in their future is maintained. "
