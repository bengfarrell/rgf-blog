Live in wine country? Come check out the _Reading Between the Vines_ Salon Series at [Moshin Vineyards](https://www.moshinvineyards.com/) in Healdsburg! On **Monday, March 19, 2018** at **6 pm**, I'll be reading in Moshin's tasting room as part of this unique literary series [(Full info here)](https://dotcal.com/embed/event?unique=2d530f20&accesskey=2d530f20ebcmobileblock&cacheTimeS=21600&lookaheadS=180&eventID=dotCal-d8fb91a0-f27e-0135-8452-525400960dde&url=http://dotcal.com/embed/mobileblock?u=2d530f20&filter=&current_url=http%3A%2F%2Fdotcal.com%2Fembed%2Fmobileblock%3Fu%3D2d530f20&whitelabel=no).

_Reading Between the Vines_ celebrates the writers in residence for the [Writing Between the Vines](https://www.writingbetweenthevines.org/) fellowship, for which I was a runner up last year. Writing Between the Vines is an organization that offers yearly retreats for writers, sponsoring their lodging at the host wineries. Can you imagine the freedom to write unfettered with a beautiful winery for your scenery? Talk about a dream...I really need to re-apply this year!

I do hope you'll join me if you live in the area. I'll be sharing wine-soaked selections from my fantasy and horror fiction. Also appearing will be Rick Bailey, a winner of the fellowship:

> Rick Bailey grew up in Freeland, Michigan, on the banks of the Tittabawassee River. In college he studied English language and literature. He then moved to Detroit and taught writing for 38 years at Henry Ford College. Sometime after finishing his doctorate, he wrote textbooks for McGraw-Hill: The Creative Writer’s Craft (2009), On the Go (2011), and Going Places (2011). A Midwesterner long married to an Italian immigrant, he has learned the language and food of Italy. University of Nebraska Press published his memoir in essays, American English, Italian Chocolate. And he is currently preparing a second collection of essays, tentatively titled When the Wine God Speaks. [http://rick-bailey.com/](http://rick-bailey.com/)

Sounds like Rick's work will have us salivating! See you at Moshin next Monday.
