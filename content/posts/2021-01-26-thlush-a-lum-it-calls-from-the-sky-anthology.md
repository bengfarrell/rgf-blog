By far, my most successful short story to date has been "Thlush-A-Lum," a horror tale. It follows the coming of age of Markella, a young woman who's always been especially attuned to sound and to the way her parents keep her at a distance. Perhaps they've had good reason, she learns.

I'm excited to share that "Thlush-A-Lum" was reprinted for a third time this past fall. It appears in It Calls From the Sky, an anthology of horror short stories on the title's theme.
