![](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2012/05/Mayas-Vacation-300-x-450.jpg)It's time for my second Six Sentence Sunday post! Six Sentence Sunday is a challenge to authors to put out six sentences from any of their works, published or not, that should excite readers to read more, and it is organized by the fine folks over at the Six Sentence Sunday blog. I thought I'd continue with _Maya's Vacation_ for now, though I may include my fantasy work in the future! Here are my six:

_Maya's Vacation_ is sweet, contemporary romance published by Astraea Press and available [at their website](http://www.astraeapress.com/#ecwid:category=662249&mode=product&product=3028832 "Astraea Press") (and Amazon, Barnes and Nobles, and Smashwords) in all e-book formats.
