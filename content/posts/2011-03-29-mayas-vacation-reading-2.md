Here’s the second clip! This one takes place later that same evening, after Dean and Maya have spent the afternoon and evening reconnecting.

_Maya's Vacation_ is available for purchase (e-books only) at [Astraea Press](http://www.astraeapress.com/#ecwid:category=662245&mode=product&product=3028832), Amazon, and Barnes and Nobles.

Don’t forget to head out to my book launch party at City Beverage tonight if you’re local! I’ll just be chilling from 6:30 to 8:30 with a pile of bookmarks, family, friends, and libations. Come by and say hello, and you might be one of 5 people to win a free download of the book!

I also have two interviews posted on other blogs today about Maya's Vacation. Take a stroll over to the [Astraea Press blog](http://www.astraeapress.blogspot.com/) and [Kim Bowman's blog](http://kimbowmanauthor.blogspot.com/) to read my answers to questions about my writing style and the book. What inspired the book? Who would I cast as the main characters? Take a gander! ![MVBanner](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2011/03/MVBanner1.jpg)
