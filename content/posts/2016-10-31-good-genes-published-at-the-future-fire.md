"Good Genes," is now available to read at _the Future Fire_ as part of their 38th issue, or [Issue 2016.38](http://futurefire.net/2016.38/index.html) in the magazine's parlance.

I am super glad it was published just in time for Halloween as it's a spooky story, and a bit of an epic one, combining a modern-day tale with a narrative from the Wild West stage of American history. Sometimes, a place a refuge may bring more horror than the past left behind...

The illustration posted above is one of two that accompany "Good Genes" in _the Future Fire_. Both are done by Pear Nuallak, and I love when my stories get a little pictorial boost! Read the magazine online to see the second one! [Here's the link directly to the story](http://futurefire.net/2016.38/fiction/goodgenes.html). And here's a new teaser for you:

> The noise of the carnival had died down as the ceremonial hour approached and the townspeople made their way to the gathering place in a trickle. Clumps of dry needles covered brittle pine cones hanging from a handful of trees. The great lawn was a patchwork of mud-filled trenches, struggling green grasses, and yellowed squares that had given up the fight. A faded wicker pavilion rose up at the park’s eastern edge, in front of a free-standing wall of cement—handball courts? Two banners strung across the stage declared “Heritage Festival” and “May Our Founders Live Forever."

There are other great reasons to tune in to Issue 2016.38—free short stories by authors Ola Al-Fateh, Petra Kuppers, Kelly Rose Pflug-Back, and Damien Krsteski, and poetry by F. J. Bergmann! I look forward to reading them all. As Editor Djibril al-Ayad describes the collection:

> "Not everything is what it seems—sometimes unseen terrors lurk in every shadow, around every corner, beneath an unassuming countenance or behind unthreatening doors. We might be pleasantly surprised by the resilience of a people we expected to collapse in defeat, and we could be equally shocked by the creeping bigotry and xenophobia of our smiling neighbors. Surprises are at the heart of dramatic tension, and hidden depths and dark secrets are a recurring theme in the stories in this month’s issue."

Feel free to leave me your reactions to "Good Genes" or comment on it at [_the Future Fire_ blog](http://press.futurefire.net/2016/10/new-issue-201638.html). Whatever you do, try not to take your next next cough _too_ seriously...
