For [Six Sentence Sunday](http://sixsunday.com/ "Six Sentence Sunday") this week, I'm venturing into my recently published urban fantasy short story called _Bother_. Let's just dive right in, shall we?

> The sound of crunching bones came next, like nuts cracking but louder, so much louder. It went on for what seemed like ages, but it could only have been a few minutes. She knew it didn't take the beast long to finish a meal. The shaking died down, and the smell of sulfur grew weaker, but the creature had to be nearby. She would have to risk it; she had to get up, to go see for herself. She had to know.

Intrigued? Here's a synopsis of _Bother_:

> The apartment is taking dingy to a new level. Air quality is suffering. Trees keep falling down, and there are piles of refuse all over the neighborhood. Yet Jonah's more concerned about his awesome day at work than he is about the dragon that's taken up residence outside his home. His wife, Susan, isn't so apathetic; she spends every waking moment with a vigilante force, trying to rid the district of the dreaded creature. Can they figure out what's worth fighting for together, or will this couple be yet another casualty of the dragon.

_Bother_, along with a bunch of other wonderful fantasy and sci fi short stories, is available  in _[Bull Spec](http://bullspec.blogspot.com/ "Bull Spec Blog")_, Issue #5.
