Today, I'll be travelling from Los Angeles to the Research Triangle Park area of North Carolina for the final leg of my _Wings Unseen_ book tour. Hooray! Here I am getting a little relaxation and cold recovery in at my sister's before taking off:

I lived in Durham, NC, for eight years, and it's where my writing career got its start. So I am glad to be able to share such a wonderful career milestone with my NC community of friends and fellow writers. And there is plenty of opportunity to join us and to check out some of the great voices living in this great area of the South.

**Becca Gomez Farrell and Friends** Wednesday, 9/20, 7 pm [Flyleaf Books,](http://www.flyleafbooks.com/addresshours) Chapel Hill

At this event, I'll be reading from Serra's point-of-view, and fellow authors Margaret S. McGraw and Natania Barron will be sharingÂ stories from their own Weird West and early 1900s paranormal tales of adventure. More details: [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1857464744568860) or the [Flyleaf Books website](http://www.flyleafbooks.com/event/rebecca-gomez-farrell-and-friends).

I hope to see you at any one of these events next week, Triangulars! I'm looking forward to celebrating Wings Unseen's release with the East Coast and all the wonderful folks and friends I met while living there. There will be more events coming up in October for me in the Bay Area - including a workshop and panel discussion at ConVolution! - and I'll be sharing information on all of those opportunities to meet up soon.
