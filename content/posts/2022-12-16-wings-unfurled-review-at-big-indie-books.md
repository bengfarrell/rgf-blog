We have arrrived at the final stop of the _Wings Unfurled_ Blog Tour. And we're ending with a doozy - [a wonderful review](https://bigindiebooks.com/2022/12/15/review-of-wings-unfurled-by-rebecca-gomez-farrell/) from the folks at Big Indie Books!

My head is spinning with delight! Here's my favorite part:

> Written from multiple points of view, including that of a Moon, Esye, the writer seems to have really hit her stride with this second offering. The book nicely ties up the overall story and the reader will appreciate the resolution of the various relationships we learned about in _Wings Unseen_, and that come full circle in _Wings Unfurled_.

The whole review is thoughtful, and I appreciate the amount of time and effort it takes to review books. Each and every one means so much! Especially because they aren't intended for writers, but to help readers find the works that they'll most connect with. I hope you'll consider connecting with the Wings Rising duology!
