I am delighted that the Wings Rising series appears on the current episode of _Pondering the Orb_, a vidcast from fantasy author [Jay Requard](https://www.jayrequard.com/). In the episode, Jay reads the first chapter of [_Wings Unseen_,](/creative-works/wings-unseen/) Book 1 in the duology. This is where we first meet Vesperi Sellywn and the story gets going with a bang--or more fittingly, a poof.

The episode also features a conversation between Jay and Sam Montgomery-Blinn, who's actually the reason that Jay and I met in the first place! Sam invited us both to read for an NC Speculative Fiction Night in 2013, which was also celebrating the launch of **Bull Spec** #5, which Sam edited and in which my "[Bother](/creative-works/bother/)," my first SFF pro sale, appeared. I actually still have [video of my reading that night](http://vimeo.com/22656890)!

Unfortunately, I think Jay stays just out of the frame, but Sam introduces me at the pedestal. That one night was the first time I met so many great authors local to the RTP area, some who'd become critique partners, some _Game of Thrones_ TV night buddies, and others support in all the ways that we authors need each other to continue in this career.

Thanks, Jay, for sharing _Wings Unseen_ on _Pondering the Orb_ and for reminding me of those wonderful memories. Sure, some writers are known for their drama, but in my experience? Writers are just plain awesome and supportive people. You should get to know a few. ðŸ˜‰
