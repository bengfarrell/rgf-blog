Folks, we are nearing the end of May and nearing the time when the first batch of readers will be getting their hands on ARCs (advanced reading copies) of my book! I am excited and nervous and probably mostly overwhelmed with the whirlwind coming as _Wings Unseen_ gets closer and closer to publication.

![This'll help, right?](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/05/me-nervous-319x500.jpg) *This'll help, right?*

And you can be one of the first people to have it in your hands if you sign up for the [LibraryThing Early Reviewers](https://www.librarything.com/er/list) program and request my book! 100 review copies of _Wings Unseen_ are flying out from there soon, absolutely free. So far, only 160 members have requested a copy, so your odds are pretty good at getting one! But you only have 3 more days to request it, so get going! Here's the link again [(click here](https://www.librarything.com/er/list)). The giveaway ends on May 29, 2017.

You will find _Wings Unseen_ about two-thirds of the way down that list of books for May. So after signing up for the program, or if you are already a member, you can CTRL + F to find _Wings Unseen_ on the page or keep your eyes peeled for the cover.

There is another giveaway also underway, which I'll be posting on soon. But for now, one last time, here's the link for the LibraryThing Early Reviewers request page! [Click the link here](https://www.librarything.com/er/list).
