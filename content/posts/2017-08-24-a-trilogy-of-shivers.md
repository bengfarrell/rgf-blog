_Wings Unseen,_ my debut epic fantasy novel, is now available at bookstores and libraries and everywhere online! Here's a perspective you don't see of the cover often, the full front and back:

If you'd like to see it in paperbackÂ near you, request to have _Wings Unseen_Â ordered at your favorite store. Such requests are much appreciated! And so are online orders. You can get it from any of these retailers in paperback or ebook forms:

I would absolutely love it if you would rate and/or review the book after reading as well - ratings are life for authors! We all know we are swayed by them. ;) So a big virtual hug from Mazu for those of you able to do so.

- 8/27, 3 pm,Â [A Trilogy of Shivers, Adventures, and Fantasy,](https://www.facebook.com/events/244188962767472)Â Borderlands Books, San Francisco, CA

Gather round the summer fire for tales sure to tempt your sense of adventure but make you wonder if it's safer to stay by the flame. A trio of Bay Area authors will share readings from their works, field questions from the aliens---er, audience--and hold a signing in the celebrated other world called Borderlands, a place where speculative fiction books reign.

The fearsome threesome:
MEGAN E. O'KEEFE just won the Morningstar Trophy for the first book in her "The Scorched Continent" series. Book #3, Inherit the Flame, came out in April from Angry Robot books. Megan was raised amongst journalists, and as soon as she was able joined them by crafting a newsletter which chronicled the daily adventures of the local cat population. She has worked in both arts management and graphic design, and spends her free time tinkering with anything she can get her hands on. Megan lives in the Bay Area of California and makes soap for a living. It's only a little like Fight Club. She is a first place winner in the Writers of the Future competition.

LAURA BLACKWELL's fiction appears in various publications, including the World Fantasy Award-winning anthology She Walks in Shadows. Future publications include Pseudopod and the upcoming Strange California anthology. She is Shimmerâ€™s copy editor. You can follow her on Twitter at @pronouncedlahra and visit her website at pronouncedlahra.com.

In all but one career aptitude test REBECCA GOMEZ FARRELL has taken, writer has been the #1 result. But when she tastes the salty air and hears the sea lions bark, she wonders if maybe sea captain was the right choice after all. Currently marooned in Oakland, CA, Becca's debut fantasy novel, Wings Unseen, will be published by Meerkat Press on 8/22. Look for her new short stories in the Dark Luminous Wings and Through A Scanner Farkly anthologies this fall or in magazines such as Beneath Ceaseless Skies and Bull Spec. She also blogs about food, drink, and travel at theGourmez.com.


Events with more information available online are linked - I'll be adding links as I get more details ironed out as well! I would love to see you in the crowd, and of course, to sign your book! I think I'll also be posting some musings about the process of book publication once I get the chance to breath...which may not be until October.Â ðŸ˜…

Thank you for your support, dear readers, and I hope to see you in the world of Lansera soon!
