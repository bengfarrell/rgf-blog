I'm going to be busy this Friday promoting my fiction, through two different mediums! You, of course, are invited to join in.

First, [S. Evan Townsend](http://blog.sevantownsend.com/) will interview me at **3 pm PST** for the **Speculative Fiction Cantina** Livestream and Podcast show.

This show takes place weekly and includes a reading, so I'll be sharing a selection from _Wings Unseen_. It'll be a chance for my "radio voice" to come out, which people have told me I have for most of my life.Â I'll be appearing along with author Brian James, and based on past shows, it should be a fun, casual time of speculative fiction appreciation. You can tune in here on Friday at 3 pm PST: [LINKY LINK](http://www.blogtalkradio.com/writestream/2017/10/20/the-speculative-fiction-cantina-with-rebecca-gomez-farrell-and-brian-james)
