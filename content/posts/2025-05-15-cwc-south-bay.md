I'm excited to be speaking at the June meeting of the [South Bay Writers](https://southbaywriters.com/)! The South Bay Writers Club is a branch of the California Writers Club, one of the oldest writers organizations in the USA. I've visited the Berkeley and Newark branches before, but this will be my first time with the South Bay crew. I look forward to it!

I'll be speaking on the topic of writer critique groups, which I'm well familiar with after nearly twenty years of attending and organizing them! I'll likely touch on common ways to structure them, the pros and cons of sharing different lengths and pre-reading manuscripts or reading them aloud at the time, and the types of criticism that become more and less helpful over time as your career progresses.

If you'd like to join us, head to the community room at the [San Jose Library's Rose Garden](https://www.sjpl.org/locations/rose-garden/) branch. It's at 1580 Naglee Avenue, San Jose, CA. The June meeting begins at **10:30am Pacific Time.**
