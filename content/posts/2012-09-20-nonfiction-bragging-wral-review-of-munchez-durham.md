It's been a while since I posted a bragging entry--I still have much to share! I haven't even gotten to my Bull Spec story, _Bother_. But life gets busy, and when it does, the bragging falls off my list of to-dos. Today, though, I have a new WRAL review to share with you! Published on Monday, here is my take on the newest food incarnation in that catchy little orange building by the 147 and Fayetteville overpass. Here's your teaser:

> **[Munchëz](http://www.wral.com/entertainment/out_and_about/venue/11502984/)** is located in a little stand that switches owners and cuisines faster than new signs can be produced. I’m still in mourning for the charbroiled chicken tacos from its last incarnation called Pollos La Carbonera. But now, it has been reborn as a sandwich, burger, salad, wings and hot dog joint. Thus, a new visit was in order.
>
> **The Location:** Munchëz is in an orange and yellow hut that looms up right before the I-147 on-ramp driving up Fayetteville Road into downtown Durham. You can walk up and order at the front window or drive through, but it does take longer than fast food. My meal took about 15 minutes, which they apologized for as lengthy.

And you can read the rest at WRAL Out and About [here](http://www.wral.com/entertainment/out_and_about/blogpost/11502997/ "Munchez Review"). Want a photo to further entice you to click their way? Sure thing.
