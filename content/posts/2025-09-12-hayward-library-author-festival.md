I’m one of over 20 authors on the guest list at the Hayward Library’s Local Author Festival! This event takes place on **Saturday, October 4, 2025, from 1 to 3pm**. Here’s the library’s description:

>_Celebrate the literary talent in our community! Join us on Saturday, October 4 from 1:00 PM – 3:00 PM for the Local Author Festival, a special event featuring dozens of local authors from across genres. Authors will be on-site to meet readers, sell their books, and connect with fellow writers._
>
>_This event is open to kids, teens, and adults — a great opportunity for readers of all ages to explore new voices and support local creativity._
>
>_The event is free to attend and no registration is required. Come browse, chat, and discover your next great read!_

Here’s the link to [their events calendar](https://hayward.librarycalendar.com/event/local-author-fest-25758).

The event will be held at the main **Hayward Library at 888 C Street, Hayward, CA, 94541**. There is plenty of parking in downtown Hayward, all free, whether on the streets or in a lot.

I’m refreshing my sales pitches for *Wings Unseen* and *Wings Unfurled* so I can be ready to gab about these works of adult epic fantasy filled with mysterious mythical creatures, ghostly wizards, human strife, and ravenous moons with potential new readers and you! I’ll also have short story collections available for purchase that feature a few of my shorter works.

I’m looking forward to meeting more of my fellow authors, too! I only know a few in our southwestern corner of Alameda County, and making new friends is always a plus of these events. Here’s the full list of participating authors:
