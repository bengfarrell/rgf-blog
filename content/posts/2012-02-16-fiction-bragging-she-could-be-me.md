Time for the next entry in my self-promotion series! _She Could Be Me_ is a short story published by Flashes in the Dark back in May of 2010. And it's available online for free! It's a horror story with a Twilight Zone feel to it. Interested? Here are the first few lines:

> “I’m delayed,” Tom said over the phone. Celia could barely hear him with the thunder on her end of the line and the airport loudspeaker playing an endless stream of announcements in Spanish, a language she didn’t understand, on his. The announcer’s voice sounded ethereal and discordant at the same time, like a slightly off-tune harp being plucked.
> 
> “I’ll be home tomorrow,” he continued. “Don’t get bent out of shape, okay?”
> 
> What was a strange thing to say. She never complained when Tom was delayed.

You can read the rest at [Flashes in the Dark here](http://flashesinthedark.com/2010/05/31/she-could-be-me-rebecca-gomez-farrell/ "She Could Be Me"). Perhaps these photos will help you with the atmosphere for enjoying _She Could Be Me_.
