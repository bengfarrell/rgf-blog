Release Day is here! Or rather, release day has already come and is almost gone and I'm just now getting to a post on my own blog to mark it—it's been busy, y'all! Busy in a good way.

I am thrilled to report that whatever snafu Amazon had going on is now resolved, and you can order both paperback and ebook copies of _Wings Unfurled_ through them again. But of course, they are also availabile at all the usual suspects of online vendors! Here are your options:

[Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/p/books/wings-unfurled-rebecca-gomez-farrell/18998266?) [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/wings-unfurled-rebecca-gomez-farrell/1142462183?ean=9781946154644) [Meerkat Press](https://meerkatpress.com/books/wings-unfurled/) [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHJLYHWF) [Apple Books](https://books.apple.com/book/id6443885149?ign-itscg=30200) [Kobo](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/wings-unfurled?utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_campaign=Author+Media&utm_term=&ranMID=37217&ranEAID=W1PQs9y%2F1%2Fc&ranSiteID=W1PQs9y_1_c-NA55YTZEBPSHo8DIxuWn3g&siteID=W1PQs9y_1_c-NA55YTZEBPSHo8DIxuWn3g)

And I believe it may be on Google Books now as well. As the author, it does not make a difference to me which one you order from, but ordering straight from my publisher, Meerkat Press, is best for supporting this awardwinning, quality small press!

I would also love to invite you all to my _Wings Unfurled_ Book Launch Party on **Sunday, December 18, at 4:30pm** Pacific Time! This will be a Zoom-based event, and my husband will present me with AI "art" he has generated from passages in the book, which will be a fun show-and-tell. I'll also be giving away two sets of the Wings Rising duology, so if you do not have _Wings Unseen_ already, this is a great chance to get signed copies of both books for free! After the prize drawing, it'll be a casual hangout time for friends and friendly readers.

Of course, there is also a new port of call on the _Wings Unfurled_ Book Blog Tour today! Head by the [Speculative Fiction Showcase](https://indiespecfic.blogspot.com/2022/12/wings-unfurled-wings-rising-book-2-by.html) to read Chapter 3, the first one from a brand-new character's perspective: Esye, the silver moon. Don't forget to enter the $50 giftcard prize drawing at the end of the piece!

As promised, I'll leave you with a line from the book:

> “I’ll be right back, or someone else will, okay, Izzy? Don’t go far.” “Okay,” she said. How far could she go during a _right back,_ she wondered.

And here's how I celebrated _Wings Unfurled_'s publication, with one of my favorite things...a crab roll!

May your successes be as tasty! I look forward to sharing more exciting _Wings Unfurled_ news with you tomorrow.
