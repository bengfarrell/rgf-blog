It's award nomination season among science fiction and fantasy writers! As is the custom, I'm offering a list of my short stories and novel publications from 2017 that are eligible for nomination--yes, that includes nearly all my 2017 publications. Qualifying isn't that difficult. ;)

If you are a member of SFWA, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America professional guild, then you may nominate works until February 15, 2018 for the Nebula Awards. [Here's how to vote](https://nebulas.sfwa.org/about-the-nebulas/how-to-vote-rules/). If you attended WorldCon 75 and/or registered as a supporting or attending member of WorldCons 76 or 77 by January 1, 2018, [keep your eyes on this page,](http://www.worldcon76.org/) as nominations are bound to open soon and will likely run through March. WorldCon awards the Hugos every year.

I'm planning to attend both conferences, and gosh, it'd be awfully sweet to have an extra special reason to go. ;) But seriously, the Nebula Weekend is a fantastic professional conference for speculative fiction writers, and well worth your time and money--and you do not need to be a member of SFWA or even a writer to attend. I have never been to WorldCon before, but I am hoping to get on paneling or in a reading session for this one, and I think it'll be great fun.

Thank you for considering my 2017 published works for nomination!

Here they are:

#### "Treasure"

"Treasure" appears in the _Dark Luminous Wings_ anthology from Pole to Pole Publishing, published October 2017.

#### "Garbage"

“Garbage” is a humorous sci-fi tale about crazy old ladies, immature teenagers, and aliens with an unusual appetite. It has a fair bit to say about what it means to be _native_ and how that shifts over time and with new waves of immigration. “Garbage” appeared in _Through A Scanner Farkly: The 2017 Fark Fiction Anthology_, which was published in July 2017.

#### "Holiday Invasion Trilogy"

I've barely had to the chance to tell folks this flash fiction series even exists since its publication in the Holiday Hell issue of _Black Heart Magazine_. Exist it does, and I'm proud of these one-shot explorations of what a holiday invasion might mean in three very different situations: a morning full of death and poinsettia, a Thankgiving dinner of new dishes and newly embodied relations, and the chaos of Christmas day for one very anxious, superpowered mom.

#### "What Scattered in the Wind"

This piece of horror flash fiction, done in a poetic prose style, tells of a woman struggling with her biggest regret in life and sentenced to forever re-remember it. It appears in the August 2017 chapbook collection, _Little Letters on the Skin,_ from Cleave: Bay Area Writers and the Liminal Center.

Best of luck to all the authors out there with eligible work for 2017! May the best of our work get on those ballots.
