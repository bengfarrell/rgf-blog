This coming Wednesday, I'll be appearing at _Story Hour,_ a weekly reading of speculative fiction hosted by authors Daniel Marcus and Laura Blackwell. _Story Hour_ has only been in existence since April, but already, this reading series has included a ton of great authors in our field, and I am delighted to join their ranks. I'll be reading with Laura Davy, who's a friend and a lovely person and author.

_Story Hour_ focuses on the short form, preferring that stories can be read in full during each author's half of the show. Luckily, I already have a handful of short stories recently published to share! Definitely, "An Inconvenient Quest" from the _A Quiet Afternoon_ anthology will make an appearance. Likely, my 100-word non-fiction tale, "Some Who Wander," will round out my reading. And perhaps I'll have time to fit in another story that'll be reprinted soon...

I hope to see you Wednesday at 7pm PT! You can join _Story Hour_ either through Zoom or through Facebook Live. Links to both are here at [their website](https://www.storyhour2020.com/).
