Just a quick reminder that you can now check out the responses of the three writers I tagged in [my post last week](/blog/2014/05/blog-hopping-today/ "Blog Hopping") on my writing processes. The three lovely authors who agreed to be next in my chain are as follows:

- Krysten Lindsay Hager, a new YA romance author with Astraea Press. Read her responses [here](http://www.krystenlindsay.com/blog).
- Margaret S. McGraw, a fantasy and science fiction writer with a great YA fantasy novel nearing the end of edits. Margaret's post is going up late tonight, so check [here](http://margaretsmcgraw.blogspot.com/)Â later on or tomorrow for it.
- And Katrina Rasbold, a writer of fantasy, romance, and many nonfiction books on spirituality. You can read her answers [here](http://katrinarasbold.com/?p=550).

Thanks, ladies, for participating, and I'm diving in to read what you've said now!
