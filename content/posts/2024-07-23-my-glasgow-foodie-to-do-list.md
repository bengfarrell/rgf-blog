I am excited to head to my third-ever Worldcon, [this time in Glasgow](https://glasgow2024.org/), in just a couple weeks! That excitement comes from knowing I’ll see so many great writer friends I’ve made over the years, that I’ll learn a ton about Scotland’s science fiction and fantasy storytelling history, and that I’ll get to tour some of region. But of course, I’m MOSTLY excited to seek out Glasgow’s foodie treasures!

I’m sharing a few lists of what I’m hoping to hit up in Glasgow, knowing full well that it’ll be impossible to try it all. But try I will! I’ll start out with the spots where I’m most likely to hit classic Scottish foods, though not necessarily in classic presentations. I have yet to find a spot that mentions serving cock-a-leekie (roast chicken & leeks), but I’m keeping my hopes up I’ll find them.

_I've updated the list with a few more recommendations from friends! And I've removed Where the Monkey Sleeps. It's out of business. (31 July 2024)_

1. **Café Gandolfi** – This spot comes highly recommended by my friend Rina Weisman, the long-running organizer of [SF in SF](http://www.sfinsf.org/) and the mastermind of Oakland’s 2026 World Fantasy bid. Café Gandolfi appears to have a charmingly low-key interior of wooden furniture while offering refined takes on the Scottish classics: https://cafegandolfi.com/restaurant-bar
2. **Butterfly and the Pig** – This multi-level restaurant offers adorable a la carte menu descriptions and affordable afternoon teas. The Yorkshire puddings stuffed with MANY THINGS look amazing:  [https://thebutterflyandthepig.com/the-butterfly-and-the-pig-city/](https://thebutterflyandthepig.com/the-butterfly-and-the-pig-city/)
3. **The Hidden Lane Tearoom** – This restaurant is indeed on Hidden Lane, an artisan neighborhood in the Finnieston area. They offer afternoon tea, and what looks to be an impressive, and maybe even healthy, array of sandwiches, breakfast toasts, and scones. It looks to be a great escape from the convention hubbub: [https://www.hiddenlanetearoom.com/](https://www.hiddenlanetearoom.com/)
4. **Ubiquitous Chip** – This restaurant has multiple levels of service, so you can be more casual with the brasserie, head into fine Scottish dining at the restaurant, or head all the way up to the rooftop terrace. There are multiple bars, too, and despite the name...no chips! Sign me up for that sort of playfulness: [https://ubiquitouschip.co.uk/](https://ubiquitouschip.co.uk/)
5. **Shawarma King** – While it's not exactly traditional Scottish food, I couldn't ignore the recommendations rolling in for Shawarma King. There is a sit-down location with that name across the river from the Scottish Events Center . . . but reviews seem clear that sticking with the takeout window in Merchant City and taking it to eat in the nearby Glasgow Green is your better bet. Overflowing platters and freshly baked bread make for great shawarma here: [https://www.facebook.com/ShawarmaKingGlasgow/](https://www.facebook.com/ShawarmaKingGlasgow/)

Doubtless, one of those options above will also introduce me to Irn-Bru sodas and cranachan (raspberry & oats parfait) desserts – I can’t wait! But there are some finer dining options also on my list, for enjoying a tasty afternoon or evening out:

1. **The Finnieston Bar** – This spot offers sustainable Scottish seafood, including local langostinos, oysters, and mussels. They also have a renowned gin bar. There is inside and outside seating: [https://www.thefinniestonbar.com/menus.php](https://www.thefinniestonbar.com/menus.php)
2. **The Little Curry House** – This spot comes recommended by friends who used to live in Glasgow. Their black daal, stewed for 7 hours, seems like a must. Also seems good for a tasty lunch! At dinner, they focus on serving up great Indian in tapas-style portions: [https://www.littlecurryhouse.co.uk/](https://www.littlecurryhouse.co.uk/)
3. **Mother India** - Upscale Indian, recommended by Anthony Bourdain … and my same friends who recommended the Little Curry House. The Lunch Time menu for £22.00 includes starters, mains, side breads, and the Bungalow’s ice cream, an awesome dessert spot also owned by Mother India. [https://www.motherindia.co.uk/mother-india/](https://www.motherindia.co.uk/mother-india/)
4. **Two Fat Ladies at the Buttery** – This may be Glasgow's "oldest culinary establishment" per their website, and from the pictures, it offers quite refined takes on Scottish classics. There's a prix fixe available for lunch, and a la carte for dinner. Plus, cullen skink (haddock chowder)! The desserts also look quite delicious: [https://twofatladiesrestaurant.com/buttery/](https://twofatladiesrestaurant.com/buttery/)

Of course, in Scotland, one must also drink whisky! And maybe tour a distillery while we’re at it, though there are not many in Glasgow proper. You should also note that tons of bars also have a food menu!

1. **The Pot Still** – This busy Central Glasgow bar specializes in whiskies and beer and several varieties of traditional meat or veggie pies like neeps & tatties or even mac & cheese fillings. Pretty sure I’ll be here the first night I hit town: [https://thepotstill.co.uk/](https://thepotstill.co.uk/)
2. **Clydeside Distillery** – This spot is close to the Scottish Events Center, which is a plus. Tours are available, including one that ends in a chocolate and whisky tasting. Or just get a flight and nibbles at the café. It’s a newer distillery, so the whisky may need more aging to be great … but you can’t beat that proximity to Worldcon: [https://www.theclydeside.com/](https://www.theclydeside.com/)
3. **Ben Nevis** - This local pub has a cozy, close feel and the fiddles of local musicians may erupt at any time: [https://www.thebennevisbar.com/](https://www.thebennevisbar.com/)
4. **The 78** – A great neighborhood pub recommended by friends. [https://www.the78.co.uk/](https://www.the78.co.uk/)
5. **The Flying Duck** – Also recommended by friends, this tiny bar and larger music venue is located down a flight of stairs up an alley – hard to find, fun to hang! [https://www.theflyingduck.org/bar-drinks](https://www.theflyingduck.org/bar-drinks)
6. **Auchentoshan** – This distillery is located out of town about 20 mins, so it would be more of an adventure to visit. But if you’re looking for an established distillery in the Glasgow area to try, it may be worth the trip: [https://www.auchentoshan.com/](https://www.auchentoshan.com/)
7. **Glengoyne Distillery** – I've learned that there _is_ one distillery an easy bus ride from Glasgow! From the Buchanan bus station, you can hop on the X10, and it'll take you straight to the distillery's gates! It's about an hour ride, but may very well be worth it to take a tour, taste whisky, and get a little escape into the Scottish countryside. Story-filled distillery tours start at £20.00.

You’ll note that a full Scottish breakfast has NOT appeared yet on my lists. That’s because I am NOT a fan. I don’t like beans, period, and especially not on my breakfast plate! Plus, I prefer my eggs scrambled or poached to fried and my breakfast items generally all mixed together rather than presented individually. Which is why the following cafes and breakfast spots look more appealing to me. They offer many of those tradition full breakfast items in different ways:

1. **Cup TeaRooms** – This spot has a large variety of brunch options, including streaky bacon benedicts, Lorne sausage sliders, and a unique morning tea option: [https://cuptearooms.co.uk/](https://cuptearooms.co.uk/)
2. **Tantrum Doughnuts** – The breakfast for sweet lovers! This Glasgow chain makes handmade, beautiful doughnuts with flavors like forest fruit jam, lemon & poppyseed old-fashioned, and milk & cookies. [https://tantrumdoughnuts.com/](https://tantrumdoughnuts.com/)

Now that I’ve identified a doughnut option, I’ll finish this foodie compendium with more sweet things! I’m always on the hunt for at least one great dessert on vacation. Some of these spots are a bit farther afield than the rest, but likely worth the diversion.

1. **Bungalow Café** – This café is part of Mother India, mentioned in the finer dining list. They have a light café menu, but the ice cream is the star here, which can come topped with a variety of options with names like “nougats, snowballs, hundreds and thousands, 99 flakes” and more. I look forward to learning just what they mean … by ordering them.
2. **Sugarfall Patisserie** – The individual cakes and pastries on offer at this bakery are making me drool. Tropical pavlova? Pistachio & raspberry choux? Yes, please: [https://sugarfall.co.uk/](https://sugarfall.co.uk/)
3. **Broken Clock Patisserie Café** – A variety of beautiful cakes are on offer here, usually 10+ flavors each day. I’m aiming for the one shaped like a cherry: [https://www.brokenclockcafe.co.uk/](https://www.brokenclockcafe.co.uk/)

Most of the options mentioned in my list above are within a 15-minute walk or transit trip of the Scottish Events Center, in the Kelvinhaugh, Finnieston, or Central Glasgow areas of the city. Most of them also take reservations, which is a plus! Here’s a map with all the spots marked:

Please feel free to share this list with other Worldcon attendees! And if you’d like to meet up with me for a drink or meal, shoot me an email to  [becca@gomezfarrell.com](mailto:becca@gomezfarrell.com). I’ll try to work something out! But I am also totally happy to just run into folks at Worldcon’s own socializing spaces and the hotel bar. Making plans can be difficult with full convention schedules, which I understand.

Hope to see you there!
