_Wings Unseen,_ my debut epic fantasy novel, is now available at bookstores and libraries and everywhere online! Here's a perspective you don't see of the cover often, the full front and back:

If you'd like to see it in paperbackÂ near you, request to have _Wings Unseen_Â ordered at your favorite store. Such requests are much appreciated! And so are online orders. Visit [the book info page](https://rebeccagomezfarrell.com/fiction/wings-unseen/) for links to where you can purchase it.

I would absolutely love it if you would rate and/or review the book after reading as well - ratings are life for authors! We all know we are swayed by them. ;) So a big virtual hug from Mazu for those of you able to do so.

To celebrate the release of _Wings Unseen_Â yesterday, I thought I'd do a reading on Facebook Live...but I have a ton of _Wings Unseen_ readings coming up, so I thought it'd be more fun to share some of my earliest short stories instead. And by early, I meant second to fifth grade.

Ah, elementary school storytelling. I was so precocious. You can also follow the _Wings Unseen_ Blog Tour--full of interviews, guest posts, excerpts, and reviews of _Wings Unseen_ from book blogs--over the next three weeks! Find the full schedule of tour stops here at [the Xpresso Books tour page](http://meerkatpress.com/event/wings-unseen-blog-tour/)[.](http://xpressobooktours.com/2017/06/01/tour-sign-up-wings-unseen-by-rebecca-gomez-farrell/)
