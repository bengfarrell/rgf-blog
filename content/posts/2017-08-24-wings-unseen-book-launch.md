_Wings Unseen,_ my debut epic fantasy novel, is now available at bookstores and libraries and everywhere online! Here's a perspective you don't see of the cover often, the full front and back:

If you'd like to see it in paperback near you, request to have _Wings Unseen_ ordered at your favorite store. Such requests are much appreciated! And so are online orders. Visit [the book info page](https://rebeccagomezfarrell.com/fiction/wings-unseen/) for links to where you can purchase it.



I would absolutely love it if you would rate and/or review the book after reading as well - ratings are life for authors! We all know we are swayed by them. ;) So a big virtual hug from Mazu for those of you able to do so.

To celebrate the release of _Wings Unseen_ yesterday, I thought I'd do a reading on Facebook Live...but I have a ton of _Wings Unseen_ readings coming up, so I thought it'd be more fun to share some of my earliest short stories instead. And by early, I meant second to fifth grade. You can watch the video by [clicking through](https://www.facebook.com/thegourmez/videos/vb.567409606/10154899503469607) to Facebook or click the video to play below:

Ah, elementary school storytelling. I was so precocious. You can also follow the _Wings Unseen_ Blog Tour--full of interviews, guest posts, excerpts, and reviews of _Wings Unseen_ from book blogs--over the next three weeks! Find the full schedule of tour stops here at [the Xpresso Books tour page](http://meerkatpress.com/event/wings-unseen-blog-tour/)[.](http://xpressobooktours.com/2017/06/01/tour-sign-up-wings-unseen-by-rebecca-gomez-farrell/)

**Upcoming Readings and Appearances** To promote and celebrate the publication of _Wings Unseen_, I'll be reading at or participating in several events over the next few months, and hopefully, one of those will be near you! Here's the list of where you can find me coming up, including 4 Bay Area appearances in the next two weeks:

- 8/26, 4 pm, [Wings Unseen Book Launch](https://www.facebook.com/events/845265645636939), the Octopus Literary Salon, Oakland, CA

Come join us to celebrate the release of Rebecca Gomez Farrell's first book! Wings Unseen, an epic fantasy, will be out on 8/22 from Meerkat Press--read the full summary in the discussion! You can purchase it at the Octopus Literary Salon the day of the event or pre-order on Amazon now. A few words from other authors in the sci-fi genre:

"Wings Unseen is an enthralling female-driven fantasy debut. The world, magic system, and terrific characters – with two complex, multi-layered heroines along with the male protagonist – drew me in and kept me rapt... Compelling, entertaining, and enlightening, Wings Unseen is a fantastic read!"
– Jeffe Kennedy, award-winning author of The Twelve Kingdoms series

"With a talon-like hook, Wings Unseen will grab you and not let you go."
– Mur Lafferty, award-winning author of The Shambling Guide to New York City

"Wings Unseen marries intrigue, unique worldbuilding, and political machination in a fast-paced story that will surely appeal to high fantasy and historical fantasy readers."
– Jaym Gates, author of Shattered Queen

Rebecca will be joined by authors Loren Rhoads and Dan Potter! Loren is the author of The Dangerous Type, Kill By Numbers, and No More Heroes, a space opera trilogy set in a galaxy where humans are a minority. Her newest book — 199 Cemeteries to See Before You Die — will be out in October.

Dan Potter is the author of the Freelance Familiars series. Full bio coming...
All three authors will be available for signing after reading selections from their work, and we will celebrate this milestone for Becca with the great food, drink, and community offered at the Octopus Literary Salon!
Hope to see you there!
