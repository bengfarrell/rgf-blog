My short story, _Bother_, is now available online! Bull Spec's PDF version is up, a couple of days before the official publication of issue #5 on Friday, 4/15. You can find the full contents list and order a print or PDF version [here](http://www.bullspec.com/issue/5). I may be biased, but I think you'll want the print version because of this gorgeous cover.

![bullspec-05-page001](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2011/04/bullspec-05-page001.jpg) The artwork is by Richard Case, a Hillsborough resident and comic book artist who's done a lot of work for the DC label. He picked _Bother_ to illustrate for the cover, and I love how it came out! I think it captures the feel of it quite well, and---it must be said---there be dragons! Okay, just one dragon, but it's a beauty!

If you can't wait to get a copy in your hands to read any of the fabulous fiction within its pages (including _Absinthe Fish_ by M. David Blake, which just received a Recommended from Lois Tilton, the Locus Magazine short fiction reviewer!) then join us at [Quail Ridge Books](http://www.quailridgebooks.com/event/samuel-montgomery-blinn-more-speculative-fiction-night) , 3522 Wade Avenue, Raleigh, on Friday night (4/15)! At 7:30, a bunch of North Carolinian speculative fiction authors and industry folks, including me, will be convening for readings, probable panel discussions, and more. Bull Spec #5 will be hot off the presses and available for purchase then. They will likely be an after party at Crowley's also. . .

Let me know if you're planning to go so I can say hello!

And Bull Spec's publisher just referred me to his list of where you can find the magazine locally, and in a few other states, too, though they likely won't be on the shelves until sometime next week.
