Save the date! I'll be the guest speaker for the South Bay Writers this coming June. The [South Bay Writers](https://southbaywriters.com/) is a branch of the California Writers Club, one of the oldest writers organizations in the USA. I've visited the Berkeley and Newark branches before, but this will be my first time with the South Bay crew. I look forward to it!

I'll be speaking on the topic of writer critique groups, which I'm well familiar with after nearly twenty years of attending and organizing them! I'll likely touch on common ways to structure them, the pros and cons of different lengths and pre-reading, and the types of criticism that one becomes familiar with hearing over time.

The Maker Nexxus is located at 1330 Orleans Dr. in Sunnyvale.
