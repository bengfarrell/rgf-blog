In March, I'll be appearing at the Alameda Authors' Day for the [American Association of University Women (AAUW)](https://alameda-ca.aauw.net/). This will be the second time I'm a guest for this organization, and it's flattering to be asked back!The AAUW is composed of women with university degrees who advocate for equity and education for women.

Not only did I get to share a nice long reading with the audience at my first AAUW-Alameda event, I also made a new and lasting romance-writer friend, Lea Kirk, who was my co-guest that day. Lea has released a ton of awesome works in [her romance series](https://www.leakirk.com/my-books.html) that star middle-aged and older science fiction—and usually, alien—characters.

I'll be happy if March's event turns out anywhere near as awesome as that first one! This upcoming event will take place at the "Crow's Nest" room at the Alameda Naval Air Museum, 2151 Ferry Point, Building #77. My co-guest this time will be author Janet Dawson.

As more information becomes available, I'll update this page! For now, save the date.
