The last week of September will be a busy one for me! I will be participating in two groups readings, and I'd love if you came out to support me and the great slates of other authors sharing their work at these series.

I will read excerpts from my short stories released this fall, though I'm not sure which one I'll do on which night quite yet. Those stories are "Mixed Signals, or, Learning How to Speak," a humurous sci-fi tale that is available now in Issue #9 of _Typehouse Literary Magazine_ ([info on how to get it here](/blog/2016/09/short-story-mixed-signals-typehouse/?utm_content=buffer4f978&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer)), and "Good Genes," a horror/Weird West story that will appear in _the Future Fire's_ Issue #38, publication set for mid-October.

Each of these readings is a regularly occurring literary series in the Bay Area. You'll get to hear from talented authors who write a range of genres, which is always a treat for me, as I think literary and genre fiction share more in common than in divergence. Here are the details:

> What: [Literary Speakeasy](https://www.facebook.com/events/1778695319085288/) (link goes to Facebook Event page, where you can RSVP) Where: Martuni's, in the piano room Address: 4 Valencia Street, San Francisco When: 9/29 at 7:00 pm

There's no event page yet for the Liminal reading, so just let me know below if I will find your smiling faces in the audience! I look forward to seeing you.

I will also be attending [Con-Volution](http://www.con-volution.com/) in Burlingame on 10/1 & 10/2, so I would love to meet you there as well! Let me know, and we'll figure out how to make our paths cross during the Con.
