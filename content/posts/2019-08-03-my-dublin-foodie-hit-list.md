Starting 8/14, I'll be in Dublin, Ireland, for Worldcon 77, or Worldcon 2019, if you prefer. Whatever number you affix, Worldcon is the annual meeting of the World Science Fiction Convention, the longest running fan convention in, well, the world. This year, I am a program participant, meaning I will be very, very busy moderating and being on panels, signing books, et cetera, and so on. I will post that schedule soon. But when my presence is _not_ required at Worldcon itself, you can bet I will be checking out every foodie wonder in Dublin that I can get to--and not just the hotel bar.

My hit list:

1\. [The Guinness Storehouse:](https://www.guinness-storehouse.com/en/home) This is where the famed stout is made! I'm not much of a beer drinker, but I can't be in Dublin without checking this world wonder out.

2\. Caramelized Brown Bread Ice Cream at [Murphy's](http://www.murphysicecream.ie/index.html): There are many other flavors at this Dublin ice cream hot spot, such as apple balsamic and Irish cream. But I have to try that classic Irish bread in ice cream form - it is my destiny.

3\. Cockles and Mussels at [the Winding Stair](https://winding-stair.com/): The iconic cockles and mussels that old Molly Malone sang about are a must for my list, yet many of the Irish restaurants renowned for them have only mussels on the menu. Not at the Winding Stair! This Dublin landmark is also renowned for being a popular meeting place for creative types throughout its years as a bookshop and cafe. Now it's a bookshop and restaurant instead, but it looks just as happening! Reservations will likely be made.

4\. Dublin coddle, Gurr cake, and other traditional Irish baked goods at [the Bakehouse](http://the-bakehouse.ie/bakehouse.htm): This eatery in downtown Dublin serves up the most highly respected versions of Irish classics - you can bet I'll pick up some soda bread, too, when I stop by the counter. Or maybe dine in at lunch for eggs & soldiers or a pottage?

5\. Whiskey tastings at [the Dingle Whiskey Bar:](https://www.theporterhouse.ie/) Located in downtown Dublin, this bar is made of reclaimed wood from whiskey barrels...and looks like you're inside one too! Offers flights or a five-page-long list of whiskeys and cocktails.May make a reservation depending on interest.

I already have high tea plans at the Shelbourne Hotel on the books, so I think that's enough of a hit list for a seven-day trip...though there are plenty of other options tempting me, like cocktails at Delahunt and dinner at the Vintage Kitchen. Care to join me for any of them? Let me know! But be forewarned--per my Worldcon schedule, I'll mostly be available in the evenings.
