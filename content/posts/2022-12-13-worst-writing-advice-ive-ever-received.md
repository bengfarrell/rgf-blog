Today, on the _Wings Unfurled_ Blog Tour, you can visit Ali Lucia Sky's blog, where I answer "[What’s The Worst Writing Advice You’ve Ever Received?](https://theskywriteshere.com/index.php/2022/12/09/featuring-author-rebecca-gomez-farrell/?fbclid=IwAR3nIv-jxo2Om8_wapec9JwsPTId_fMbrGyDPgYAOi2GEzTr9T-_QAZz9jU)" It's a claim I've heard many times, from many writers, but one that lacks the nuance that newer writers need to hear, in my humble opinion.

You'll also find an excerpt of Chapter 1 in the book! This comes from Serra's point-of-view, and she's at Castle Callyn for the first time in quite a while....and for _reasons_ she needs to report to King Dever right away.

Don't forget to also visit the Meerkat Press [masterpost](https://meerkatpress.com/wings-unfurled-blog-tour-giveaway/) to enter our $50 giftcard prize drawing! And now for today's contextless quote from _Wings Unfurled_:

> “I heard the Green Lady was building a new glass house, so I came with my hammer and thought to help.”
