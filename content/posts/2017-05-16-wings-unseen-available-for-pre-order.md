Ooh, maybe not that one. That looks dangerous. Regardless, it's time to celebrate because my YA/New Adult epic fantasy, _Wings Unseen_, is now available for pre-order!

You can order it from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Wings-Unseen-Rebecca-Gomez-Farrell/dp/1946154008/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494907396&sr=8-1&keywords=wings+unseen) or from [Barnes & Nobles](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/wings-unseen-rebecca-gomez-farrell/1126061986?ean=9781946154002) for now, and you bet I'll announce when it's available from other sources. The official release date is August 22, 2017! Did I not mention that before? \*browses website\* Wow, I really did not mention that before. Apparently, getting your tonsils removed puts you off your promotional game. Luckily, [Meerkat Press](http://meerkatpress.com/) is continuing to be a phenomenal small press, so word is getting out about this book, and ARCs go out this month. So exciting! Stay tuned for giveaway info, but also go ahead and click on one of those pre-order links if you can...what, you want more enticement? How about an excerpt from the book? Here's one of my photos to conjure your imagination:

And here's the excerpt. In it, Vesperi, a main point-of-view character who lives on the Meduan side of the mountains, where a highly questionable moral code reigns, makes a visit to an herbalist:

> "Vesperi Sellwyn! It has been ages since I saw you last. You have been too busy with those fancy lordlings to come visit old Graw." His voice scratched like the black scruff on his chin. "Though I have noticed fewer coteries riding through of late." He cocked his head. "Did those suitors find the merchandise too used?"
>
> She glared. "None of them were suited to my needs."
>
> "Oh, I am certain I have something that would suit your needs." He grabbed at the sagging bulge beneath his belt.
>
> She ignored him. "You do, actually. I have need of fallowent. Do you know of it?"
>
> "Fallowent, aye, I may have some of that, though it's scarce these days. The plants grow best by the river, and they disappear as fast as the Sell's waters." His face lit up as he spoke, confirming what Vesperi had pieced together years ago—this man loved his craft more than his pleasures. He was harmless, as far as men went.
>
> Each hobbled step he took drew forth a curse. After some shuffling and banging, he returned with a pot in hand. Cloying scents of honey and musk rose up as he lifted the lid. She dipped a finger and it came out coated in black, sticky seeds no bigger than a flea.
>
> "I will need more of it." She had no idea how long it would last. "So you had best figure out how to get some or my father will hear of it."
>
> His face paled. "I will. There is no need to tell your father. I will have the guards take me foraging tomorrow."
>
> "Good. I will return for more next week."
>
> He raised his elbows as she made to leave but stopped her at the door. "You were right­—"
>
> She narrowed her eyes.
>
> "—about those men, your suitors? To reject them."
>
> Vesperi had little patience for stammering, but this was an unexpected compliment.
>
> "I know you are a woman and Saeth teaches that women are prized only for their cunts and the kitchens, but fallowent won't do anything to make that brother of yours a man. He would let us all fall into the hands of Durn, or Saeth forbid, the cow lords of Yarowen."
>
> Graw shuddered, and Vesperi gave him a brilliant smile, encouraging him to continue. "I would—I would rather you take over than him someday, and you can't do that if you get married. I am very attached to my store, you see—" he petted the padded arm of his chair, "—and I would prefer things stay this way."
>
> "If we are lucky, my father will live many more years."
>
> "Of course," he said hurriedly. "I did not mean to suggest—"
>
> "You didn't," she assured him. "And Saeth may yet give my mother another son Lord Sellwyn can be proud of. We must pray for that."
>
> He nodded, eyes downcast. But his head lifted when she placed an extra pile of souzers on the table.
>
> "Your loyalty is noted by House Sellwyn." It was all she could say safely. She exited without another word, but the hood did not feel quite as binding when she pulled it over her head.
