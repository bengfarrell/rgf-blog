["She Could Be Me"](/creative-works/she-could-be-me/) was one of my very first short stories published, back in 2010. Sadly, its original publisher, the e-zine _Flashes in the Dark_, no longer exists. But I'm delighted to announce that _Bards And Sages Quarterly_ has rescued "She Could Be Me" from obscurity!

This issue of the magazine came out in April 2021 — yes, I'm behind in sharing publication news, AGAIN. You can pick up the e-book for $3 or the print version for $9 from Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091DWHD2K). I quite like Editor Julie Ann Dawson's short description of my story, in this collection of eight short stories in all:

> A peculiar phone call from her husband is only the first in a strange series of events that upends a woman’s well-manicured life in "She Could Be Me."

I hope you'll pick up a copy of the April 2021 _Bards And Sages Quarterly_ and give it a read! Our new kitty, Bemo, did. ;)
