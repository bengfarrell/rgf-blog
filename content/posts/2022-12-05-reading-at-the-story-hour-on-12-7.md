Join me on Wednesday, when I’ll be appearing at _Story Hour_, for the third time! Story Hour is a weekly speculative fiction reading hosted by authors Daniel Marcus and Laura Blackwell. I'll be reading with Barbara A. Barnett.

_Story Hour_ focuses on the short form, preferring that stories be read in full during each author’s half of the show. This means that I will **_not_** be reading from my new book, _Wings Unfurled._ But I will be sharing a humorous science fiction tale, ["Garbage,"](https://rebeccagomezfarrell.com/fiction/garbage/) that was published a few years back. This story's about a pair of immature teenagers playing a prank on the neighbor, but it's also about opinions on immigration and assimilation.

I hope to see you **Wednesday, 12/7/2022, at 7pm PT**! You can join _Story Hour_ either through Zoom or through Facebook Live. Links to both are here at [their website](https://www.storyhour2020.com/).

Post-Event Recording Info:

I shared "[Garbage](https://rebeccagomezfarrell.com/fiction/garbage/)," a humorous, but as host Laura Blackwell described it, "funny and disturbing," science fiction story. I read with Barbara A. Barnett, who graces the first half hour with a short, sad read and then a longer, funny tale that'll make you think twice before your next bite of salad.

My half starts about 25:00 minutes into the Story Hour. I hope you enjoy the listen!
