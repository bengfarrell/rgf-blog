I lived in Durham, NC, for eight years, and it's where my writing career got its start. So I am glad to be able to share such a wonderful career milestone with my NC community of friends and fellow writers. And there is plenty of opportunity to join us and to check out some of the great voices living in this great area of the South.

**An Afternoon of YA Fantasy** Saturday, 9/23, 2 pm [Barnes & Noble,](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/) Cary

JoinÂ  myself (and a reading from Janto's POV) and Tony Daniel, author of the Wulf's Saga series from Baen Books for an afternoon of YA fantasy storytelling and book signing. This event is part of the B-Fest celebration of Teen Books at Barnes & Noble nationwide! More details: [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/285090175338351) or [Cary Barnes & Noble website](https://stores.barnesandnoble.com/event/9780061891005-0).

I hope to see you at any one of these events next week, Triangulars! I'm looking forward to celebrating Wings Unseen's release with the East Coast and all the wonderful folks and friends I met while living there. There will be more events coming up in October for me in the Bay Area - including a workshop and panel discussion at ConVolution! - and I'll be sharing information on all of those opportunities to meet up soon.
