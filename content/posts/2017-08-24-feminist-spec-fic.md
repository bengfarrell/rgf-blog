[Feminist Spec Fic night](https://www.facebook.com/events/349587845473101)\
The Liminal Center\
Oakland, CA

Women have been writing speculative fiction since its invention...by a woman! Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is credited with creating the science fiction genre, and the women of scifi, horror, and fantasy haven't stopped since 1818. Perhaps we CANNOT be stopped? What unearthly power COMPELs us? Maybe coming out for this reading will help us investigate that matter...

A fantastic slate of female speculative fiction writers will be reading this night at the Liminal Center in Oakland. The Liminal Center is a creative space that fosters the artistic voices of female and female-identifying artists and writers. Our works will be available for purchase and signing after the event, and Liminal offers refreshments for donations.

Here are the truly Fantastic Five Feminists reading this night:

DANA FREDSTI is an ex B-movie actress with a background in theatrical combat (a skill she utilized in Army of Darkness as a sword-fighting Deadite and fight captain). She is the author of the Ashley Parker series, touted as Buffy meets The Walking Dead, as well as what might be the first example of zombie noir, A Man’s Gotta Eat What a Man’s Gotta Eat, first published in Mondo Zombie. She also wrote the cozy noir mystery Murder for Hire: the Peruvian Pigeon (Fox Spirit Books), is co-author of What Women Really Want in Bed, and has written several spicy genre romances under the pen name Inara LaVey. Additionally, Dana has a new urban fantasy series, Spawn of Lilith, with Titan Books, the first coming out June 2017. She also has a story coming out in V-Wars 4: Shockwaves, and a story, “Crash Course,” in the upcoming anthology Joe Ledger: Unstoppable.

She lives in San Francisco with her husband and fellow author David Fitzgerald, with whom she’s co-writing Time Shards, a science fiction trilogy for Titan Books. They share their house with their dog Pogeen, and a small horde of felines.

AUDREY T. WILLIAMS is an Oakland-based writer and an MFA Candidate in the Writing program at California College of the Arts. She is working on her first speculative fiction novel, as well as personal essays about her multi-racial family life. Audrey is a child of the '80s who grew up on the North Carolina coast near Camp LeJeune. Her fondest memories of youth include: watching Star Trek with her father and learning to make lemon pickle and mango chutney with her mother. She has been deeply exploring her cultural and racial identity formation, as well as healing via ancestral memories and spiritual gifts. www.imaginingfutures.org
