I am super excited to be reading at [Barrow's Intense Tasting Room](https://barrowsintense.com/) in Brooklyn on **April 18 at 7pm**! The Rooftop Readings series -- currently indoors and not on a rooftop due to, you know, THE COLD -- is organized by the super awesome debut novelist and super-talented entertainment journalist Randee Dawn. This reading will also feature Nadia Uddin, Richie Narvaez, and Katharine Duckett!

Barrow's is at 86th 34th Street, Brooklyn, NY (D train to 36th Avenue, then about a 5 minute walk). You DO NOT NEED TO PURCHASE A TICKET to attend, but if you'd like a drink while you're listening, please make sure to snap one up for $10 at Eventbrite. Which honestly? A cocktail in Brooklyn for $10? What a deal! Nevermind the entertainment! Purchase a ticket here: [https://buff.ly/3G9ZVEZ](https://buff.ly/3G9ZVEZ) and learn more about the Rooftop Reading Series here: [https://buff.ly/3Mq63wT](https://buff.ly/3Mq63wT)

Yes, this is basically my springtime promo blog tour for _Wings Unfurled_, and I cannot wait to share this sequel with East Coast epic fantasy fans! SF in SF went great, and now NYC will get its own taste of this book. And I'll get to taste Barrow's Intense Ginger Liquor, and honestly, I'm probably just as excited for that.

I'm looking forward to raising a glass with you, Brooklynites!
