I'll be appearing at a few events in the Bay Area, coming up this week and next. Here's the deets on one of them:

**Strong Women • Strange Worlds Birthday Book Fair**

I’ll be taking part on Facebook in [Strong Women • Strange Worlds](https://strongwomenstrangeworlds.weebly.com/)’ Birthday Celebration Book Fair on **Saturday, March 18, from 12pm to 1pm PT!**

This event intimidates me, to be honest. Why? Because it’s _not_ a reading but twenty minutes of time for me to just talk about my books, my writing process, the publishing industry, and maybe even how my foodie ways influence my fiction. I’m afraid of being a rambling mess....but if you’d be entertained by a rambling Rebecca Gomez Farrell, check it out! SWSW’s birthday festivities will be going on all day, but you should be able to [tune in here](https://fb.me/e/2BcceGZU5) on Facebook at 12:00pm to find me. Sumiko Saulson and KC Grifant will also be authors on display during that Book Fair hour.
