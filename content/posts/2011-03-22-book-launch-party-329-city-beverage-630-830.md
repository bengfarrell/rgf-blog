It's only 7 days until the launch of my first book, _Maya's Vacation_, and I'm getting quite excited!

As many of you have asked, yes, I am holding a book launch party to celebrate! This is not an organized shindig so much as it is an excuse to have drinks with friends. The wonderful Johanna, the Durham Foodie, arranged for me to stake out a spot at City Beverage in Durham from 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm on 3/29, the date the book launches. If you are a blog reader, friend, whomever, you are more than welcome to come. My plan is simply to chill in the Lava Lounge (the purple room) the whole time. I will be armed with bookmarks for _Maya's Vacation,_ and I'll be giving away a few free downloads of it. I'll also have some flyers printed promoting my short story and readingÂ  with _Bull Spec_ on 4/15. Swing on by anytime between 6:30 and 8:30 and say hello! Please let me know if you can come!

I'll also be doing book readings on this blog that Tuesday, probably two recorded readings from the book to whet your appetites for the $2.99 download. It will be available in all e-book formats at [Astraea Press](http://astraeapress.com/#ecwid:category=662267&mode=product&product=3028832) on 3/29--buy one, buy two, buy five and send them around to anyone you know who doesn't mind a little romance mixed in with food and wine descriptions sure to make you hungry. It's a book about reigniting passions, whether they be joy in cooking, creating, or accepting what Fate throws your way.
