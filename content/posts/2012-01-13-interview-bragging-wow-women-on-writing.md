Two weeks ago, [I posted the first](/blog/2012/01/fiction-bragging-last-complaint/?utm_source=rss "The Gourmez Bragging Series") in my series of self-promotional blogs on Thursdays, titled the Bragging series, because I always feel less self-conscious about anything if I just embrace it fully. This week, I'm pointing you toward the interview I did with WOW! Women on Writing as part of placing third with the story I shared two weeks ago, _Last Complaint._ Here's a little snippet from the interview where I describe what some of my thoughts were in forming the main character:

> **WOW: That's so true. Creating a hook that keeps readers invested is the goal. Your creation of the main character is brilliant. She's self-centered, lonely, demanding, and vulnerable. That's a powerful combination. What does her attitude say about the state of humanity?**
>
> **Rebecca:**Â Since she spent her life not taking other people's feelings into consideration, she essentially removed herself from humanity and they no longer wish to consider her feelings, either. Through rejecting the simple human connection that comes from things as basic as treating the people around you with respect, she has essentially lost the right to that same treatment herself. Not that I want people to read about a murder and cheer on her death, per se, but I do like that it's a bit of a comeuppance for her and the way she's lived her life.

[Read the rest of the interview here](http://muffin.wow-womenonwriting.com/2009/12/interview-with-rebecca-gomez-farrell.html "Rebecca Gomez Farrell interview"). If you do, you'll learn about my other motivations for writing _Last Complaint_ (hint: they aren't that deep), why I started this blog in the first place, and my long and sordid history with _General Hospital._ This was the first interview I did regarding writing, and it's still one of my favorites, even if I gave the dreaded "Write, write, write" answer for what advice to give new writers. I still hang my head in shame when I remember it.
