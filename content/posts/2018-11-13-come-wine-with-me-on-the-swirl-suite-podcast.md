Catching up on appearances I've made over the past couple of years for food and fiction, and lo and behold! I never promoted my episode of _the Swirl Suite_ podcast from last year! I love this group, or "squad" as they call themselves, of female wine and spirit professionals of color, based mainly in the DC area. Last year, they did a series, "Get to Know a Wine Blogger," and I was thrilled to be asked to take part. Surprisingly, the only subject that's out of date is that my fantasy novel, _Wings Unseen_, is no longer coming out but has been out for a year. Oh, and we're a year past that Wine Bloggers Conference in Santa Rosa as well. Details, details. Otherwise, it's a pretty fun interview!

In this 42-minute episode, you'll first listen to Sarita [Vine Me Up](http://www.vinemeup.com/), Glynis [Vino Noire](http://www.vino-noire.com/), Leslie [Vino 301](http://vino301.com/), Tanisha [Girl Meets Glass](http://girlmeetsglass.tumblr.com/), and Melissa [the Liquor Lady](http://liquorlady.com/) talking about summertime humidity, Juneteenth, and Oz restaurant's Happy Hour in Arlington, VA. About eight and a half minutes, the ladies start chatting up myself and Tivon of [Von Vino](http://vonvino.com/about-von-vino/).

Tivon and I talk about how we got into wine blogging, how drinking it got us into wanting to record it and learn more about it. Then we all talk about the wineries we visited most recently and I say "like" way too often, as per usual. I'm a California Valley Girl - I can't help it. Great tips follow for advice to wine bloggers just starting out, our favorite happy hours (shoutout to [the Libertine](https://www.facebook.com/The-Libertine-Oakland-403850353122641/)!), we play a word association game, and a surprising truth is revealedâ€”very few of us keep cases of wine at the ready! I also share some of my fiction writing process, which I'm in the depths of on two different books right now.

Or check out the show below on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPIkBfol_18wzfPJVyIZoWQ), which I queued up to right before my and Tivon's introductions. Thanks for tuning in! And thanks to the Swirl Suite Squad for having me.
