We're only 20 days out from Christmas, and thus the time for gift giving is upon us! For $15, you can send a signed, personalized copy of my epic fantasy, _Wings Unseen_, to anyone you love - heck, it's cool if you send it to someone you only kind of like, too. ;)

![wings unseen, book, epic fantasy](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/Octopus-Launch-15.jpg) *My friends, Paul and Ann, whom I kind of like, I guess, getting their signed copies at my book launch.*

$15 includes the book, and my signature and a personal message, filled out from your instructions on whom I should address that message too. It also includes shipping costs! What is _Wings Unseen_? [Here's my full page on it.](https://rebeccagomezfarrell.com/fiction/wings-unseen/)

**This price is only available until 12/16**. After that, I won't be able to ship via media mail in time for Christmas. But I am happy to use a more expensive shipping option to get it to your loved one for opening under the tree!

How to order? You can contact me via direct message on [Facebook,](https://www.facebook.com/thegourmez) or or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thegourmez/) or just email me at [becca@thegourmez.com](mailto:becca@thegourmez.com). We'll discuss payment and shipping methods - either Paypal, Square, or Venmo will work, and I am amenable to other shipping options, but the price will reflect those other options.

Or you can just order _Wings Unseen_ off Amazon! It's only $12 currently, which is a deal! But that doesn't include author signature...

Happy holidays, dear readers, friends, and family!
