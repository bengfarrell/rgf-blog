Hey, it's not a holiday season without an obligatory "Buy My Work!" post from an author. I swear it's in the contracts we sign in blood with our publishers...somewhere...I seem to have misplaced them.

![Oh, I think I remember how...](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/12/stocks-500x500.jpg) *Oh, I think I remember where...*

In 2015, I added two new opportunities to purchase my work, which is one way of saying some very lovely people agreed to include me in their collections -- some even paid me for it! One is a short story in a magazine and one is a contribution to a cookbook...a cookbook with quite illustrious co-contributors from the Speculative Fiction galaxy. Being a member of a professional organization comes with some perks, just sayin'.

Consider this my purchasable compendium, reverse chronological order! Collect all five! And come this time next year, there will be a novel to add to this list, one way or another...

**_1\. Ad Astra: The 50th Anniversary SFWA Cookbook_**

![](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/12/Ad-Astra-Cover-372x500.jpg)

Fran Wilde and Cat Rambo edited this collection of 150+ recipes from speculative fiction authors of the past, present, and maybe even future. In it, you can find my Seared Peaches with Prosciutto and Basil; it comes with high acclaim from the NC Research Triangle area spec fic community. Purchase the cookbook fro[m the SFWA website here](https://www.sfwa.org/sfwa-publications/preorder-your-sfwa-cookbook-now/) or from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Ad-Astra-50th-Anniversary-Cookbook-ebook/dp/B011YM8874/ref=as_sl_pc_ss_til?tag=thegou07-20&linkCode=w01&linkId=JP2WFYOCC3CKANLS&creativeASIN=B011YM8874).

**2\. "Thlush-A-Lum" in _PULP Literature_ Issue #5**

"Thlush-A-Lum" is pure horror that would qualify as flash fiction in most markets. The story came about when I challenged myself to write something more focused on the sense of sound than the other four I more commonly use in my writing. Many of those sounds are inspired by what I could hear from my own Southern bedroom window…and a few sounds that I swear I’ve been able to hear no matter where I’ve lived.

Purchase Issue #5 from [the _PULP Literature_ website](http://pulpliterature.com/subscribe/the-bookstore/issue-5-winter-2015/) or from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Pulp-Literature-Winter-2015-Issue-ebook/dp/B00SG554G6/ref=as_sl_pc_ss_til?tag=thegou07-20&linkCode=w01&linkId=22543GMBGFF6WNI5&creativeASIN=B00SG554G6).

**3\. "Blow 'Em Down" from _Beneath Ceaseless Skies_ Double Anniversary Issue #131**

![beneath ceaseless skies](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/12/beneath-ceaseless-skies.jpg)

"Blow 'Em Down" is the story I describe as a steampunk retelling of the Battle of Jericho with a jazzy feel circa Harlem Renaissance. It's been taught in a college class and brought me some of my highest compliments, so I certainly think it's worth the read. _Beneath Ceaseless Skies_ is not available in print, but the e-magazine can be purchased through [Weightless Books](https://weightlessbooks.com/genre/fiction/beneath-ceaseless-skies-issue-131/) or on [Amazon.](http://www.amazon.com/Beneath-Ceaseless-Anniversary-Double-Issue-ebook/dp/B00FDUE076/)

**4\. "Bother" in _Bull Spec_ #5**

![](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/12/bullspec-05-page001-800x1024.jpg)

"Bother" was the cover story for _Bull Spec_ #5, and I'm honored to this day that the highly regarded Richard Case chose to illustrate it. It's urban fantasy about how a couple survives, or doesn't, when a dragon comes to roost on their city block. Luckily, there appears to still be back issues of _Bull Spec_ available, although the magazine has shifted to a web-only presence. [Order Issue #5 her](http://bullspec.com/issues/bull-spec-5/)e or an e-version from [Weightless Books here](http://weightlessbooks.com/genre/fiction/bull-spec-5/).

**5\. _Maya's Vacation_**

![](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/12/Mayas-Vacation-300-x-450.jpg)

The contemporary romance novella I never expected write, _Maya's Vacation_ came to be in a dream about frying chicken, and I fleshed that dream out into the story of a woman in her fifties rediscovering herself after a divorce and relearning what she used to love through food, paint, and an old flame returned. _Maya's Vacation,_ published by Clean Reads, is available on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Mayas-Vacation-ebook/dp/B004UB1REI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1380500960&sr=8-1&keywords=maya%27s+vacation). Warning: No sex scenes in this romance! Just unrequited longing. Or is it requited? I'll never tell.

I may also mention that anything you buy that features my work is a gift to me as well -- word of tongue can only spread after eyes on the page have done their business. Of course, I also have plenty of fiction free to read online as well -- just click over to [the Creative section](/creative-works/) to find it. Thank you for your support, and I hope to keep entertaining you in the future. I'm pretty sure I'll have some snippets to share by the end of next week as well...
