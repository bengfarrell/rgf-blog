This Sunday, **10/14,** at **3:30 pm**, I'll be on the [Pursuit of Publishing: It Takes a Village Panel at Litquake!

![litquake 2018](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/LQ-2018-horiz.png)

This is my first ever Litquake appearance, and I'm excited to participate. Panel description: What does it take to create and sustain a writing community? CCA's Leslie Roberts discusses strength in numbers with Mary Volmer (Hedgebrook), Scott James (Castro Writers Coop), Casey Bennett (Lit Events for the Lit-Minded), and . . . me! I'll be sharing about my work co-helming the [East Bay Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/East-Bay-Science-Fiction-and-Fantasy-Writers/), a San Francisco chapter of [Women Who Submit Lit](http://womenwhosubmitlit.org/), and two closed Facebook groups for female writers - one for speculative fiction writers across the globe and one for writers of all stripes in the Bay Area.

Some tickets will be available at the door, but a few tickets are still onlineÂ for $25. That price includes three earlier panels on the same day, all designed to aid writers on their path to publication. All four _Pursuit of Publishing_ panels will take place at the Timken Auditorium of the California College of the Arts at 1111 Eight Street in San Francisco.
