I concluded [my writer-in-residency](https://rebeccagomezfarrell.com/posts/2016-05-27-reading-tonight-at-liminal/) at the Liminal Center in June, but I am still fully in support of this awesome, communal, feminist space for women in the creative arts to come together to learn and grow our talents together.

#### Fall Workshops Offered

One of Liminal's primary purposes is to provide hands-on writing workshops for writers who identify as female. These six-week sessions provide valuable instruction from experienced writers and instructors in small groups, and they are starting soon! Sign up before these classes begin on 9/18.

May I recommend **Origin & LIMINALITY: Experimental Writing** with Gina Goldblatt? It's one of two workshops Gina is leading, and as the founder of Liminal, you'll get a great view into the heart of this organization. Learn to write subversively while exposing truth through fiction.

Liminal stalwarts Terrilynn Cantlon and Brenda Usher-Carpino are both at the helms of workshops as well. Terrilynn will be **Silencing the Critic Within**, an essential dragon to tame for anyone seriously venturing into the creative arts. Brenda will delve into **the Art of Dramatic Dialogue** for character development in the dramatic arts.

The Liminal Fall Workshops are offered on a sliding scale of $200-$320—Pay what you can afford to support this awesome literary organization! Liminal also reserves two spots in its workshops for participants who can't pay at all. Contact Gina at gina@theliminalcenter.com if that's your situation.

#### One Day Intensive Workshops

For the first time, Liminal is offering one-day writing seminars, which I personally think is a great idea as that's the commitment level I can handle. The first one is happening tomorrow, September 10th, and it's not too late if you'd like to **Get Into the Writing Groove** with Jenee Darden.

There is a great set of one-day classes on the agenda throughout the fall, including how to **Write Characters of Social Action** with Jasmine Wade, creating the heroes we need to see in fiction these days. Jasmine is also teaching **the Wonderland of Myth: Writing into the Past and Present**, which I would love to take if I were in town that day. \*cry\* Sessions on grief writing, healing from trauma through writing, and writing about negative experiences are also on the agenda.

Pricing for the one-day intensive sessions depends on the length of the course, whether a couple of hours or a full day. Whatever course or workshop you choose, Liminal will greet you with welcoming, supportive arms. Or at least that was my experience co-working at Liminal with these lovely women this last spring.
