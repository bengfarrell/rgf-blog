_Woosh!_ That was my schedule zooming by too fast for me to keep up with it. Thus, I haven't had time to give my next reading much promotion, but there's still time! Barely.

Tomorrow night, **Tuesday 10/24**, I'll be reading at the Literally series at **[the Shop at Flywheel Press](https://www.facebook.com/TheShopFWP/)** in **San Mateo** at **7:00 pm** along with author Peter Carroll. Flywheel Press is an art and design center in San Mateo that has fostered a unique creative space in many different forms: as a letterpress studio, a co-working space for artists, a First Fridays destination, an art gallery, and a provider of classes for kids and adults.

If you'd like to share your own work, there will be an open mic afterward, too! And of course, I'll have _Wings Unseen_ available for purchase, should you like a signed copy. ;)

I hope you'll join me!
