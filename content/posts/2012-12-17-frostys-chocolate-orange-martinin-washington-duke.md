**Frosty's Chocolate Orange Martini at the Washington Duke Inn**

For the month of December, you can order a cocktail of my very own creation at the [Washington Duke Inn’s](http://www.washingtondukeinn.com/) Fairview Dining Room and Bull Durham Bar. I won first place in their Blog Nog cocktail competition for my riff on a Terry’s chocolate orange. It’s that magical stocking stuffer we’ve all had on many Christmas mornings. Give it a whack, and the ball breaks into a million perfect slices of orange-flavored chocolate. My trivia team, Wrong Answers are Sexy, gets the credit for coming up with the theme of chocolate orange, and Tara Skelly in particular gets honors for being my taster.

The night of the winner unveiling, _Durham Magazine_ [posted a brief piece](http://www.durhammag.com/blogs/durham-magazine-blog/washington-duke-cocktail-recipe-contest/) on my victory, from which I’m stealing this picture.

You can also watch the following video of bar manager Chris Thomas mixing up the concoction.

But if that’s too much work for you, then here’s my recipe with the tweaks the bartending team came up with to make it better—mainly, they perfected the rimming steps. The drink naming was a team effort led by Don Ball, the director of food and beverage at Washington Duke Inn, from among the fellow competitors and food bloggers who came by for the unveiling.

**Frosty’s Chocolate Orange Martini**

2 shots orange juice\
1 shot Stoli Vanil\
2/3 shot white crème de cacao\
1/3 shot Grand Marnier\
1 shot cardamom-infused simple syrup\
Finely grated Terry’s White Chocolate Orange\
Granulated sugar\
Slices of Terry’s Milk Chocolate Orange

Directions: Chill a martini glass. Rim the glass with extra cardamom syrup, then duck it in a mixture of the ground chocolate orange and sugar. Shake up the first 5 ingredients. Pour into the martini glass. Garnish with a slice of chocolate orange on the side.

Better yet, give the drink a try straight from the expert hands of Washington Duke’s bartenders! It’s $10, and you’ll find these cute little table toppers there.
