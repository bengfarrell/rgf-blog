I'm joining in with Six Sentence Sunday this week, giving my fiction fans six sentences from one of my works to see if it entices you. Six Sentence Sunday is mainly perused by romance authors and readers, so when I participate, I try to include something a bit similar to that genre. This six comes from my short story, _Treasure_, that I'll soon be submitting to a speculative fiction magazine.

> By now, she knew such things were repulsive here, that killing another human was anathema to his race, yet she was amazed he could focus on anything but her curves in the morning light.

> “Get dressed,” she commanded, “or don’t you plan to work today?”
> 
> He gazed at her for a moment, groaned, and then rose. With both hands, he pulled her face toward his, kissed her, then whispered in her ear, “You’re safe with me, Filor.”
> 
> Her cheeks colored, both with flattery and shame. She could not trust him with her real name—did the shame mean she wanted to?

 

Hope you enjoyed it!
