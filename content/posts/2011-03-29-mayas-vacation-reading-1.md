That’s right, folks. The day has finally arrived, and I am now a published book author! I can’t thank you all enough for your support over these last few crazy weeks. I hope you’ll pick up, by which I mean download, a copy of _Maya’s Vacation_ soon. It’s available as an e-book only, but you can get it in whatever format you want: PDF, Nook, and Kindle files are all supported. Purchase it directly from my publisher, [Astraea Press](http://www.astraeapress.com/#ecwid:category=662245&mode=product&product=3028832), or from Amazon or Barnes and Nobles. It’s only $2.99 for 50 pages worth of romance, food, wine, and a relaxing, quick read.

To celebrate, I’ve recorded two excerpts from the book for your listening pleasure. Each clip is about 3 minutes and 30 seconds, enough to give you a glimpse of the artsy retreat Maya attends, the delicious food Catelyn makes for all the campers, and the long-absent connection she rediscovers with a certain surprise guest . . .

Here’s the first clip! The second one will be available later this afternoon.

Don’t forget to head out to my book launch party at City Beverage tonight if you’re local! I’ll just be chilling from 6:30 to 8:30 with a pile of bookmarks, family, friends, and libations. Come by and say hello, and you might be one of 5 people to win a free download of the book!

I also have an interview posted on the cover art for Maya's Vacation today. Take a stroll over to [Kim Bowman's blog](http://kimbowmanauthor.blogspot.com/). What inspired the cover art? Who would I cast as the main characters? Take a gander! ![MVBanner](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2011/03/MVBanner1.jpg)
