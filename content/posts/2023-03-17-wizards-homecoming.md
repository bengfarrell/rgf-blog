I'll be appearing at a few events in the Bay Area, coming up this week and next. Here's the deets on the next one:

**The Wizard's Homecoming Book Launch**

I am thrilled to celebrate my friend, the talented Elwin Cotman, and his new speculative poetry collection, _The Wizardâ€™s Homecoming_, this coming **Friday, March 17, at 7:00pm Pacific Time**! I'm also thrilled that he asked me to read as part of the celebration.

The book launch takes place at [Hasta Muerte Coffee](https://hastamuertecoffee.com/) in Oakland, and Elwin will also be hosting comic artist Dan McCloskey for the evening. Come on out! [More Info.](https://fb.me/e/2ABUj9I3t)
