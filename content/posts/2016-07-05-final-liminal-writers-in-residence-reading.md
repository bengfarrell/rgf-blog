This Friday night, you can catch me reading as part of the final reading session for the Spring group of Liminal Writers in Residence!

**What: FINAL Reading - Spring Writers in Residence and Workshop Attendees**\
**Where: Liminal, 3037 38th Avenue, Oakland**\
**When: Friday, 7/8, at 7:00 pm**

I will be reading from "Garbage," a humorous sci-fi tale that I've been chipping away at for quite a few years, including during the last two months at Liminal. It never fails to draw laughs from readers, so I'm pretty sure an audience will react the same! I'll be going on right at 7:30 pm, when the actual readings start, but I'll be sticking around throughout the night's program, as listening to this diverse and talented group of writers is always a worthwhile evening.

Here's the Facebook event link: [https://www.facebook.com/events/1761472000741686/](https://www.facebook.com/events/1761472000741686/)

I will not be continuing with the Liminal Writers in Residence co-working program after this, as I am shifting my focus to the speculative fiction community in the Bay Area, but I will make sure to come out and support Liminal's events whenever possible. There's always something happening at that great space for female writers of every stripe and background.

Hope to see you Friday!
