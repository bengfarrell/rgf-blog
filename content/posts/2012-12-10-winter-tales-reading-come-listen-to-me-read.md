Winter Tales Reading: Come listen to me read!

This coming Thursday, I will be one of five speculative fiction writers participating in a reading on the topic of winter tales at the Orange County Public Library in Hillsborough (137 W. Margaret Lane) at 6 pm.

Personally, I’m most intrigued to see what a pack of sci-fi writers comes up with for holiday-themed readings! I am opting for a personal essay, and I know at least one of the other authors is writing a song or three. I’m honestly expecting this to be a lot of fun. Here are brief bios of the other participants. By brief, I mean this is how I am most familiar with them:

- [James Maxey](http://dragonprophet.blogspot.com/)\-Author of the _Dragon Age_ fantasy saga and his current _Dragon Apocalypse_ series. He’s also a great conversationalist at dinner parties full of people you’ve never met before. Or at least that’s my experience.
- [Gray Rinehart](http://www.graymanwrites.com/)\-Author of several short stories, slushmaster general at Baen Books, and singer of songs.
- [Mur Lafferty](http://murverse.com/)\-2012 Campbell Award nominee, author of _Playing for Keeps_ and the _Afterlife_ series, expert podcaster, and composer of snarky social media statuses.
- [Alex Granados](https://www.facebook.com/AlexGranadosWrites)\-Author of _Cemetery Plot_, producer of _the State of Things_, and that guy that was supposed to edit a short story for me once.
- and me, [Rebecca Gomez Farrell](http://rebeccagomezfarrell.com/)\-Author of _Maya’s Vacation_ and several short stories, food blogger extraordinaire, and the person who wrote this post.

Please come on out on Thursday at 6 pm and join us for the merriment! It will continue all evening for me, because I have a date with _the Hobbit_ at midnight that night!
