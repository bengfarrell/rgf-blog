It has come. This is the last week I'm spending on bragging about _Maya's Vacation_, my romance novella about a woman who has to decide if she wants to chance her heart on an old flame all while painting and eating her vacation away. This week, I'm sharing a few snippets of interviews I've done to promote _Maya's Vacation_. I was interviewed at a couple of romance book and author sites. If you've ever wanted to learn a bit more about me or my romance novella, you should swing by them!

![readerbutton1](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2012/05/readerbutton1.jpg)First up is [I Am A Reader, Not A Writer](http://iamareadernotawriter.blogspot.com/2011/06/author-interview-novella-giveaway-mayas.html "I Am A Reader, Not A Writer") from last June. Here is your teaser:

> **What is one book everyone should read?** 
>
> _The Sparrow_ by Mary Doria Russell. It is a beautiful book that blends religious striving, human suffering, cultural understanding, and language into a narrative about learning to live with aliens on another planet and learning to live with ourselves.
>
> **What is your favorite flavor of ice cream?** 
>
> Viennese Cafe Waltz—it was a specialty flavor done by Safeway Groceries’ store brand for a few years: chocolate covered hazelnuts in a cinnamon, vanilla, and mocha ice cream.
>
> **What is your favorite thing to eat for breakfast?** 
>
> Eggs Goldenrod—cheese sauce over toast with sliced and grated hard-boiled eggs. Calories for the win!
>
> **Night owl or early bird?** 
>
> Very much a night owl. I get a lot of eye rolls when I say I wake up around 10 am...until I remind them that means I’m in bed around 3 am.
>
> **Skittles or M&Ms?**
>
> M&Ms, especially those new coconut ones. If they made those in dark chocolate, I’d be in heaven.

![astraealogo](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2012/05/astraealogo.jpg)Next on the agenda is [Astraea Press's blog](http://astraeapress.blogspot.com/2011/03/tremendous-thursday-new-release-mayas.html "Rebecca Gomez Farrell interview"), where I did an interview the day of _Maya's Vacation_'s release.

**A random fact about your story.**

> Scrabble is not a recommended matchmaking method.**A random fact about you as an author.** 
>
> I’ve been writing stories since I mastered handwriting—though whether I’ve ever actually mastered cursive is up for debate. My first stories involved the La Brea Tar Pit and taking a ride on a unicorn with She-Ra. It was horror and fantasy from an early age.
>
> **Favorite line in the story (can be funny, romantic, etc).**  
>
> My favorite line in the story is actually the very last one, which I dreamed—or rather, I dreamed a version of it that needed some editing. But I can’t share that one! Instead, I’ll pick this: _Maya thought that interesting, but Dean’s soothing voice, like jazz spilling out of a sidewalk café, distracted her from giving it any further consideration._

![jvaughn](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2012/05/jvaughn.jpeg)Since three is such a beautiful number in writing, I'll end the interview bragging post with this snippet from [Fridays Off the Wall](http://joselynvaughn.blogspot.com/search/label/Rebecca%20Gomez%20Farrell "Fridays Off the Wall") at Joselyn Vaughn's blog last year.

> Joselyn: Who would you cast as the main characters in a movie of your latest book?
>
> Rebecca: In _Maya’s Vacation,_ the main character, Maya, is a woman in her early 50s. She has a salt-and-pepper bob and an intuition that guides her strongly. I could see Kathy Najimy playing her. Dean, the main romantic interest, is an artist of the same age, lanky, and has a mop of curly blonde hair. Richard Gere with long hair would be a fun choice and would get that emotional angst just right, but I’d love Viggo Mortenson also. Danny Devito would be a perfect actor for Maya’s bustling friend, John. Naomi and Wynona Judd would have great fun playing Opal and Esther Donnelly, a pair of randy widows, as long as they don’t mind dying their hair pink.
>
> Joselyn: I love the idea of a not 20-something heroine.  We can find love at any age. What is your favorite line for your most recent book?
>
> This is not from a book but from my short story, _Apocalypse_, published recently at Yesteryear Fiction. It is about a woman—a diviner, actually—who is noticed by someone else for the first time in her life, which makes her realize that she’s worth noticing: _His face is alight with the reflection of something dazzling, something she has never seen but always been._ From the novel, I can only give my second favorite line—my first is the last line of the book, and I don’t want to give that away! My second favorite is _Maya thought that interesting, but Dean’s soothing voice, like jazz spilling out of a sidewalk café, distracted her from giving it any further consideration._
>
>  Joselyn:  That is really nice imagery. Do you have any characters who keep bugging you for their own book? Will you give them one?
>
> Rebecca: I assure you, both John and Opal from _Maya’s Vacation_ are quite confident they are worthy of their own books, largely because they find themselves infinitely entertaining and think they are great catches to anyone of the opposite sex. The fact that I have no plans to do so simply mystifies them. Obviously, I’m not paying due attention to their charms, and they may be forced to try harder.

I hope you enjoyed those little tidbits on why I wrote _Maya's Vacation_ and just plain learning more about me. I can't leave you without showing off that cover one more time:
