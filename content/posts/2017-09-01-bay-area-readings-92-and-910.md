I have two more Bay Area readings coming up in the next two weeks! Which means two more opportunities for locals to come hear a little more about _Wings Unseen_ and get me to sign your book - it's a harmless experience, I promise! ![rebecca gomez farrell wings unseen signing](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/09/IMG_5817.jpg)

### A Reading of the East Bay Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Meetup Group

Where: Mad Monk's Center for Anachronistic Media, Berkeley

When: 9/2 at 1 pm

What: The East Bay Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Meetup Group has been going strong since 2011! This critique group for speculative fiction writers of all adult ages and career stages has provided input for a great number of talented writers over the years. A great collection of talent has come through this group, and we thought it'd be nice to spotlight a few of them finding success as featured readers while also giving current members the chance to read their works in a supportive setting for perhaps the first time in the form of an open mic. We will have three featured readers: Rebecca Gomez Farrell, Andrew Roberts, and Tantra Bensko. Afterward, the reading will transition to an open mic for authors of speculative fiction to share excerpts of their works of up to 600 words, or 5 minutes of reading time.
