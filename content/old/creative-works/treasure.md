- “Treasure,” a fantasy fable, is available in the _Dark Luminous Wings_ anthology from [Pole to Pole Publishing.](http://poletopolepublishing.com/) The official anthology publication date was October 20, 2017. Here’s the cover:

![dark luminous wings rebecca gomez farrell](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/pages/DLW_eCover_Final_72dpi.jpg)“Treasure” is one of my oldest short stories. It features a female thief who's thrust into a culture very different from her own, so different, she has a difficult time believing such a culture is real. Can someone raised to distrust everyone around her accept grace and love when freely given it? Is it truly given freely? You’ll have to read “Treasure” to find out what Enkid, the story’s protoganist, makes of these questions…under threat of a flying sea monster called the Laklor and the lure of a rock pillar that manifests jewels and….here are the first few lines:

> Wind thundered past the slats of the storage cabin. Hidden within a barrel of fish guts, the stowaway braced herself for lurching. But when the ship pitched sharply sternside, Enkid knew it was no ordinary squall. A storm this bad would force the captain out of his quarters despite his usual drunken stupor, creating an opportunity to filch the beveled, green-glass vial he wore around his neck. It held hemlock tincture, a rare poison that would come in handy for someone in Enkid’s line of work.

_Dark Luminous Wings_ is available on Amazon in print or e-book forms.

You can find all the other purchasing options at [the publisher's book page](http://poletopolepublishing.com/books/dark-luminous-wings/). I'll leave you with an image from a Paperhand Puppet Intervention show, which may, or may not have, influenced the Laklor's description.
