Carpe Durham_ is food blog devoted entirely to the food scene in Durham, NC, where I spent 2005â€”2013. It's a very popular blog, and while contributors like myself get the ball rolling, the real treasure is in the comments from the readers. Somehow, discussing the authenticity of a new joint's lengua tacos spirals into discussions of whether upscale restaurants are classist on a regular basis. Durhamites are smart ... and opinionated.

I posted at _Carpe Durham_ under the name MEZ, but I was far from the primary contributor. That would be DID, who has been doing an amazing job keeping the site constantly updated with reports on the newest Durham restaurants and food-related events.

Carpe Durham shut down in the 2010s.
