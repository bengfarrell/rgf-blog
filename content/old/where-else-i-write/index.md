Over the course of my writing career, I've had the pleasure of contributing columns, posts, and articles to a few different websites, in both the food/drink and entertainment categories. Currently, I write articles for _[Indiezone.TV](http://indiezone.tv/ "Indiezone.TV"),_ which is a lot of fun. Most of their articles on the film industry over the past year have come from my keyboard. And there are a lot!

You can find my present-day food and drink blogging right here on this site, where I now focus on the Bay Area in California. Of course, wine and spirits follow no geographical bounds, so I'm only speaking of reviews particular to a restaurant, bar, or coffeeshop. This blog was previously titled _the Gourmez_, a nom de plume I've used in many online arenas. You can read about my food blogging history here.

I'm not partnering with any other food/drink blogs at present, though I may have a new travel venture to update y'all on soon. However, prior to my relocation to the Bay in Fall 2013, I also contributed to the _Carpe Durham_ group blog. It's an award-winning blog that focuses on the dining scene in Durham, NC.

Also in NC, I wrote for WRAL's _Out and About_ blog on Research Triangle area events and entertainment for my last year in RTP. You can find my articles there through this link.

I've managed to garner a few mentions and praises for my food writing over the years as well. Those are listed at

For past entertainment writing, well, I love suspending disbelief and relish escaping into other worlds onscreen and onstage. Thus, extending my writing into the appreciation of other entertainment forms is natural for me. I may, perhaps, revel in some fangirl tendencies as well. Writing about the shows I love has been a way for me to validate those obsessions.

For several years, I wrote television commentary for [_All My Writers_,](http://allmywriters.net "All My Writers") one of the longest running soap-opera-commentary websites. You can learn more about my columns on primetime television, General Hospital, and Glee right over here.
