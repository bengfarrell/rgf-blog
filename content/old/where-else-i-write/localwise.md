Localwise is a Berkeley-based start-up that's essentially a classifieds board for local jobs. They began with listings in Berkeley and Oakland only, but after six months of operation, they've expanded to Alameda, Emeryville, and San Francisco with more Bay Area locations in the works. Â The site is easy to navigate and a much preferred alternative for local businesses and applicants over that _other_ free classifieds site. You know the one.

One of the most appealing aspects of Localwise is their commitment to building community in the Bay Area, because knowing your neighbor and neighborhood business owner generally tends to improve everyone's quality of life. As part of that goal, Localwise runs a blog that highlights local businesses, job profiles, and the food & drink scene. Why that last item? Because food industry positions make up around 2/3 of Localwise's job listings at any given time. That's right--2/3! We like to eat here, folks. We like to eat a lot.

Where I come in, along with a few other Bay Area food & drink bloggers, is through contributing short articles to the group blog on a monthly basis. These posts cover various aspects of the Bay Area food and drink scene, from new restaurants to urban wineries to coffee cupping opportunities.
