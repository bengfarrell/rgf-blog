The Doctor's Order** is my _General Hospital_ column. You can find the [most recent entries here](http://allmywriters.net/?s=doctor%27s+order&x=32&y=25 "The Doctor's Order") at _All My Writers_. I aim to give a weekly diagnosis of the show's conditions and the wisdom behind the characters' shenanigans. In a show full of doctors, mobsters, and split personalities, you can bet there are plenty of those.

Every other week, **the Doctor's Order** posts first at the [Official General Hospital Fan Club](http://ghfanclub.com/ "The Official General Hospital Fan Club") site. I've had the pleasure of being their official commentary writer since 2010.

Once upon a time, however, this column was called **This Week's Specials** instead. In that incarnation, I focused on giving a complete description of all the tasty dishes served up in Port Charles each week, though they sometimes left a bitter taste. Other times, however, the results were decadent.

I've been watching this show since the womb, and I remember it since I was 5. It really has had a big presence in my life. I'm never afraid to admit that.
