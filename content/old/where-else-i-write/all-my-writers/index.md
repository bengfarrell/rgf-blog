For several years, I wrote television commentary for [_All My Writers_,](http://allmywriters.net "All My Writers") one of the longest running soap-opera-commentary websites. We were previously known as _Eye on Soaps_, but when ABC cancelled two of the sudsies, we broadened our horizons to include primetime, books, movies, and whatever else struck our fancies. I primarily wrote about _General Hospital_ and _Glee,_ but other shows occasionally drew my eye.

My three regular columns:

- [The Doctor's Order](/entertainment-writing/the-doctors-order/ "The Doctor's Order")
- [The _Glee_\-Full Gab](/entertainment-writing/the-glee-full-gab/ "The Glee-Full Gab")
- [Pursued by Primetime](/entertainment-writing/pursued-by-primetime/ "Pursued by Primetime")

In July 2012, 2013, and 2014, I also served as press at the _General Hospital_ Fan Club Weekend. I was the official photographer for the Fan Club, and I also conducted interviews with several of the actors for _All My Writers_.

- [Actor Interviews](/entertainment-writing/actor-interviews/ "Actor Interviews")
- [_GH_ Fan Club Weekend Event Reports](/entertainment-writing/gh-fan-club-weekend-event-reports/ "Event Reports")

Alas, I am no longer writing for _All My Writers_ as other writing gigs and projects have taken priority for me. But I will always be grateful to the other past staff members at the website for their welcome and belief in my commentary on the shows.
