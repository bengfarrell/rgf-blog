Welcome to my little neck of the interwoods! I plan to use this blog for discussion of political, philosophical, and religious topics and I want you to please talk back! My friends and family cover a broad range of ideals, from tree-hugging Jesus freaks to atheist anti-tax activists to feminist stay-at-home parents. Most of you know that my views on the issues tend to fall all over the place so I’d appreciate your insights and reasons behind why you believe in what you believe, whether it be that climate change is a sham or that Google’s going to take over the world. Ultimately, I want this blog to help me better understand my own views and also inform my fiction writing.

I’m also going to vent, review movies and books, and make various other random musings on occasion, just because I can.
