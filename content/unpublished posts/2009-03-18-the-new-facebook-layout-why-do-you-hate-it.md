Okay, so it's been maybe a week since Facebook debuted its new layout.  I, for one, love it but I seem to be in the minority.  Either that, or the haters are just very vocal about it!  So here's why I love the layout:

<!--more-->

1. It's essentially the same layout.  No, really, not that much has changed; it's just arrayed differently.  You can still access all your applications from the application bar at the bottom of the page.  You can still read up on anything and everything people have done and it's easier to do so because it's all together in one feed.
2. No more tabs!  I try to follow what all my friends are posting, linking, poking, commenting on, etc.  I like to be in the know, what can I say?  In the former layout, you had to click on a different tab to access each different type of update, whether for groups, links, etc.  Now, it's all centralized in one running log, unless, of course, you decide you'd rather use one of those handy dandy filters for a more detailed selection.  This means I am not clicking through 5 or more different pages and selecting "show older" a gazillion times on all those different pages.  Now, I only need to do so on one page.  Rejoice!
3. I don't get the feeling that I'm missing something.  It's all there, on the main page.  With all the clicking between tabs before, I was always certain I was missing things, especially as all the applications were not available to be tabbed.
4. I don't see the same updates show up in different tabs.  For example, status updates would show on the first tab that used to be the "newsfeed" for your favorites (totally useless if you don't want favorites), then on the status update tab, and also on the log that would show short or long stories.  So I'd do all that clicking only to be trying to find the diamond in the rough on some pages that I hadn't already seen on the other pages.  My time is much less wasted.
5. That "show older" link actually seems to work now.  It used to only work occasionally on the old layout-sometimes I could go back and find updates I hadn't seen yet and sometimes...I couldn't.  Seems to always work now.

So those are my not terribly articulate reasons why I like this layout.  What are the reasons that you hate it?  Please, explain your rage to me!  I may regret this, but I seriously have no clue what's so bad about the layout.
