[![](images/Prowl-icon-150x150.jpg)](http://allmywriters.net/?cat=12)Every fall, I watch a lot of TV. I'm curious by nature, and I can't help checking out the new network shows. I want to give each one a shot, though 80% of them fall by the wayside over time. More often than not, it's because I forget they even exist before the networks give them the axe. So this year (2013), I started a new column with _All My Writers_ to help with my memory problem. I'm making a list and checking it twice, giving insight into why I do or do not continue with a new show to the next episode. I'm also throwing in quick reactions to the series I regularly watch as well.
