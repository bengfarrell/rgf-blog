WRAL is the local CBS television station for the Research Triangle area of North Carolina. They have an extensive online presence at _WRAL.com_, and it's definitely the place you want to be for information on potential tornadoes. Trust me.

Out & About_ is the events and culture headquarters at _WRAL.com_, and I occasionally write restaurant reviews for _What's on Tap_, the entertainment, night life, food, and drink blog within _Out & About._Â

I was asked to write for _What's on Tap_ in early 2012, and I contributed a review for WRAL.com every other month until the summer of 2013. It was great fun to be on the fringes of this group of industrious, yet sweetly sane, journalists. They made me tired -- I'm happy to just eat food and take photos.
