I organize a Bay Area chapter of the national Women Who Submit Lit organization, which encourages all writers who identify as women and/or genderqueer to submit our work out for publication through the creation of safe spaces and resources for those writers to access. If you're in the Bay Area, CA, and interested in learning more, contact me at [becca@gomezfarrell.com.](mailto:becca@gomezfarrell.com)
