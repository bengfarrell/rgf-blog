"Some Who Wander" is a short, but not sweet, piece of micro-nonfiction that appears at _Instrinsick m_agazine_._

What does micro-nonfiction mean? It means this creative work is less than a hundred words long, and it is an account of one of my many adventures while taking a walk. It turned out slightly better than the time I fell into a blackberry thicket and ended up with poison oak for weeks . . .

Because this tale is so swift, I'm not going to share a lead-in quote. Instead, I'll explain the story's title.

> All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost; The old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
>
> JRR Tolkien, _The Fellowship of the Ring_

Now, Tolkien is writing about Strider here, a ranger in Middle Earth who wanders purposefully through the wilds. Strider, of course, will soon be revealed to be Aragon, the rightful king of Gondor. It is one of my favorite bits from the _Lord of the Rings_ series. But while "not all who wander are lost," my title, "Some Who Wander," is meant to imply that some who wander are, indeed, quite lost, as you'll learn when you read what happened to me.

I will also give you some photographic inspiration to set the mood:
