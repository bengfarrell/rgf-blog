"Hobgoblin" is a short, but not very sweet, story that explores just how a creature such as a hobgoblin might come to exist. I had some fun thinking about the power of names and of miscommunication between folks of very different backgrounds for this one. It most recently appears in _Whigmaleeries & Wives' Tales_ from Jayhenge Publishing, published in September 2020. Whigmaleeries & Wives' Tales is a collection of over 400 pages on new fairy tale takes - or retellings of lost knowledge, if you'd like. ðŸ˜‰ You can [purchase it here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HGL7LNY/ref=rdr_kindle_ext_tmb) at Amazon, in ebook or paperback formats.

That anthology is "Hobgoblin's" second printingâ€”it was a runner-up for the Fall 2017 _WOW! Women on Writing_ Flash Fiction contest, and it was published by _WOW! Women on Writing_ in February 2018.

You can read Hobgoblin in full [at this link.](https://www.wow-womenonwriting.com/downloads/printable/82-FE1-Rebecca-Gomez-Farrell.html) Here are the first few lines to entice:

> Hobgoblin, they name me. The wordâ€™s consonance fills me with venom. If squeezed together on the page, the letters would ooze disgust: hob. . . gob . . . lin. Itâ€™s a corruption of my time-honored service and an insult to my squat and sturdy frame. To call me that and wonder why I torment them? I feel the evidence is plain.

Also, I was interviewed on the Muffin Blog about writing Hobgoblin. [Check that out here.](https://muffin.wow-womenonwriting.com/2018/04/meet-flash-fiction-top-ten-contest.html)

And some photographic inspiration...
