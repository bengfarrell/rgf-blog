"A Holiday Invasion Trilogy" is exactly what it says: a collection of flash fiction stories about invasions during the holiday season. These are true flash fiction pieces; the whole trilogy is less than 900 words. The stories appear in the Holiday Hell issue of _Black Heart Magazine_, released December 23, 2017.

_Black Heart Magazine_ issues are available only as e-books, but you can get them at Amazon, Gumroad, or Smashwords for an affordable $2.99. The magazine publishes short fiction of all types, along with a monthly column and book reviews. Here's the Amazon order button:

And here are the first two lines of each of the trilogy pieces:

> Hostess Gifts: A shower of identical snowflakes dusts the windows, signaling the attack. Poinsettias throughout North America rustle leaves in a strange sort of fan dance.
>
> How Tradition Lost Its Tang:  Patrick, Colinda’s great nephew, slides an unearthly pile of mulberry-colored goo onto the table beside the stuffing. “It’s yogurt with açai berry, so much healthier than cranberry."
>
> Unwrapped: Frosted pastel and bold red-and-green wrapping papers mosaic the floor beneath Leah’s impeccably decorated tree. Anxiety latches onto her at the extremities.
