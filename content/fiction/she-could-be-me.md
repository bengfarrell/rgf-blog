"She Could Be Me" is a short story most recently published by _Bards & Sages Quarterly_ in April 2021. It's a flash horror story that's _Twilight Zone_ meets "The Ladies Who Lunch."

"She Could Be Me" was first published in _Flashes in the Dark_ in May of 2010, but that publication is out_of_print. Find it now in the much more recent April 2021 issue of  _Bards & Sages Quarterly_ [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091DWHD2K).

The first few lines to whet your appetite:

> “I’m delayed,” Tom said over the phone. Celia could barely hear him with the thunder on her end of the line and the airport loudspeaker playing an endless stream of announcements in Spanish, a language she didn’t understand, on his. The announcer’s voice sounded ethereal and discordant at the same time, like a slightly off-tune harp being plucked.
>
> “I’ll be home tomorrow,” he continued. “Don’t get bent out of shape, okay?”
>
> What was a strange thing to say. She never complained when Tom was delayed.
