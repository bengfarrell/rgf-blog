The first few lines to whet your appetite:

> “I’m delayed,” Tom said over the phone. Celia could barely hear him with the thunder on her end of the line and the airport loudspeaker playing an endless stream of announcements in Spanish, a language she didn’t understand, on his. The announcer’s voice sounded ethereal and discordant at the same time, like a slightly off-tune harp being plucked.
>
> “I’ll be home tomorrow,” he continued. “Don’t get bent out of shape, okay?”
>
> What was a strange thing to say. She never complained when Tom was delayed.
