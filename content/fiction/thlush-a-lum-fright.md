\* In September 2018, "Thlush-A-Lum" received its second reprinting! That makes this my most successful short story thus far. This time, "Thlush-A-Lum" formed part of the **_Fright into Flight_** anthology from Word Horde.

Links to purchasing can be found at Word Horde's [publication announcement here](https://wordhorde.com/take-wing-with-our-new-anthology-flight-into-fright-available-today/). Or head direct to Amazon.

\* "Thlush-A-Lum" was first reprinted by **[the Centropic Oracle](http://www.centropicoracle.com/),** who produced an audio version of the story, released on December 8, 2017. Unfortunately, the Centropic Oracle has since shut down. Sarah Houghton performed the audio narration.

\* "Thlush-A-Lum" first appeared in **_PULP Literature_ Issue #5** in 2015.

It's also available through Amazon. What's "Thlush-A-lum" about, you wonder? It's pure horror that would qualify as flash fiction in most markets. The story came about when I challenged myself to write something more focused on the sense of sound than the other four I more commonly use in my writing. Many of those sounds are inspired by what I could hear from my own Southern bedroom window...and a few sounds that I swear I've been able to hear no matter where I've lived.

The first few lines? Certainly.

> Markella's earliest memories are of the sounds outside her window. At hours when no men moved, rustling branches and shuffling grass woke her. A beating pulse like slower, fleshier helicopter blades banished sleep: thlush-a-lum thlush-a-lum. In summers, the heat in her attic bedroom hot enough to incubate, Markella pushed the window open and dozed to the endless static drone of cicadas. In winters, choking radiator warmth wrapped tight around her, she cracked the window and the low, deep hoots of an owl drifted in with the freezing breeze.
>
> The sounds crept in no matter the season.

And you know I like to include a photo to set the mood when I can...
