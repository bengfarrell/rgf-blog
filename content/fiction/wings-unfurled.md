You can also order it from your fave local bookstore!

Now, the first question you’re going to ask me is which vendor should you buy it from so that I get the most royalties? The answer is honestly that I get the same royalties no matter where you buy it from. But if you’d like to support my publisher, then ordering directly from Meerkat Press is best.

The second question is “So, what's it about, Becca?” Well, here’s the backcover blurb!

> _The vicious claren that used to plague the reunited countries of Medua and Lansera are long gone. So what are the new dark patches appearing in Lady Serra's second sight?_
>
> _She rushes to King Albrecht to report the danger, only to discover that he's ailing and Vesperi, Prince Janto's wife, has fled far to the north to grieve her disappeared daughter._
>
> _Vesperi still wields the silver flame, possesses all the authority she's ever wanted, but nothing can heal the wound of a missing child. When the silver moon Esye begins to fade, a gnawing fear preys on her for the first time since she escaped her father's cold rule._
>
> _Ominous creatures once thought mythical are now rampaging through the countryside. Janto sends Serra to investigate. But without her friendship and Vesperi's love, he fears he cannot slay this challenge. He failed to find his own daughter, after all._
>
> _To save the Lanserim, the legendary bird with three heads must fly again. Will Janto, Vesperi, and Serra find the strength to raise it? Or will this menace, with the might to drain a moon, devour them first?_

I hope that gets you excited to read about the new adventures and challenges Vesperi, Janto, and Serra face, six years after the events of _Wings Unseen_. I also shared a geeky writer note on book structure with my newsletter subscribers this past weekend, so I'm going to share it with everyone now: I didn’t know that _Wings Unfurled_’s organization would so closely follow _Wing Unseen_’s when I started writing it, but I’m delighted that it worked out that way. _Wings Unseen_ is laid out in two parts: The Breeding Season and The Culling. _Wings Unfurled_ also has two parts: Moonfall and Moonrise. Two stanzas of prophetic prophesy are also very important to both plots!

Here’s a teaser of the first two lines of the new prophecy from _Wings Unfurled:_

>  _When leaps the mighty cantalere_ _the dark brother drains his foes._ 

Uncover the rest of that prophecy and what it portends for the Lanserim by reading _Wings Unfurled_!
