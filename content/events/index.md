Design first two headings similar to boxes with details on <https://ta-nehisicoates.com/events/>

Boxes will link to Event posts, all under the category of "events" "reading" "readings" or "appearances".

# Upcoming

Note: this heading disappears when none are upcoming.

Boxes should include the date as H2, the event title as H3, and the location as H4. Left-align featured images within each box. Clicking the box leads to the individual post.

# Past

Note: same format as above boxes. List events in reserve chronological order, including the ten most recent. Include a "See Older Events" link to a search that includes all Posts categorized as "events" "reading" "readings" or "appearances"

# Recorded Appearances

In a carousel, show 3-5 most recently recorded appearances. Include video or audio screencap â€“ ideally, could just play from this page. List events in reverse chronological order. Include a "See Older Events" link to a search that includes all Posts categorized as "recorded". Open to suggestions on how to design this part better.
