Somehow, I managed to overlook posting here about a nonfiction essay I wrote last fall! "The Circle Broken: Pushing Daisies Leaves Room for Pie" appears in _Journey Planet_ #58 "Cancelled Too Soon!"

This special double isssue of the Hugo-nominated fanzine was "dedicated to Television Programs that were cancelled after two seasons or less! Thrill to tales from fans, critics, show-runners, inspirations, and writers about the shows that were loved, or at least watched, and lost." Steven H Silver edited the issue. You can [download it here](http://journeyplanet.weebly.com/journey-planet---2021-hugo-nominee/issue-58-cancelled-too-soon) for free.

What did I write about? Why, as you can tell from the title, the answer is _Pushing Daisies_!

![](https://d2ypg8o05lff0b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/25214703/pushingdaisiescover-3.jpg)I've long listed _Pushing Daisies_ as one of my all-time favorite shows, but because it lasted such a short time, that was really more wishing for what could have been than the reality of what the show was. You see, it's easy to view something with rose-colored glasses when it's been snuffed out in its prime, before the realities of a long life add depth to that vision....but now, I'm getting ahead of myself. ðŸ˜‰ If you're interested in pondering how _Pushing Daises_ broke the cycles of life and death, and how having the show's own cycle get cut short may have been the best thing that could have happened to it, then take a few minutes and dive into "The Circle Broken: Pushing Daisies Leaves Room for Pie."

Of course, there are a great many other essays on great works of television that did not get their due in this issue of _Journey Planets_! Enjoy the excuse to relive a little of those works that you loved and download the issue.
