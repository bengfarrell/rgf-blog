In winter of 2012, I participated in "Winter Tales," an annual reading of holiday-themed works at the Orange Country Public Library in Hillsborough, NC.

My piece, _Treasures in Cardboard Boxes_, was about my father's mixed tape of Christmas carolsÂ  and the panic I felt when I thought I had lost it forever. You can watch me read the essay in the following video:

[Head to my blog](https://rebeccagomezfarrell.com/posts/2013-01-14-winter-tales-reading-come-listen-to-me-read/) for the full evening's worth of readings, including song and story by authors James Maxey, Mur Lafferty, Alex Granados, and Gray Rineheart.
