In these pages, you will find books featuring my photography during the _General Hospital_ Fan Club Weekends, interviews I've conducted with _General Hospital_ actors, and my event reports from those events in 2012-2014.

I am alsoÂ occasionally inspired to take fingers to keyboard in praise or critique of plays I've seen live. They have appeared both on this blog and at _All My Writers_.

In 2015, I will be expanding my coverage of entertainment to include film reviews as they come up. I'm not committing to a regular schedule, but I plan to take up the occasional offer for film screenings and to share my thoughts on those films with you.
