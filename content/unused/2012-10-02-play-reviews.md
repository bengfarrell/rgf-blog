I haven't done many play reviews since I started blogging actively in 2009, but there have been a few. I've seen a great number of plays and musicals, but I have to be truly inspired—or just really excited to see a specific actor—to take the time to give the play its due with a review. They have appeared in _the Gourmez_ and _All My Writers_.
